Sophia,"Sophia, Bulgaria",42.6977,23.3219,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1717,"After four days journey from this place over the mountains, we came to Sophia, situated in a large beautiful plain on the river Isca, and surrounded with distant mountains.

Sophia,"Sophia, Bulgaria",42.6977,23.3219,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1717,"IN one of these covered waggons, I went to the bagnio about ten o'clock. It was already full of women. It is built of stone, in the shape of a dome, with no windows but in the roof, which gives light enough. There were five of these domes joined together, the outmost being less than the rest, and serving only as a hall, where the portress stood at the door. Ladies of quality generally give this woman a crown or ten shillings; and I did not forget that ceremony. The next room is a very large one paved with marble, and all round it are two raised sofas of marble, one above another. There were four fountains of cold water in this room, falling first into marble basons, and then running on the floor in little channels made for that purpose, which carried the streams into the next room, something less than this, with the same sort of marble sofas, but so hot with steams of sulphur proceeding from the baths joining to it, 'twas impossible to stay there with one's cloathson. The two other domes were the hot baths, one of which had cocks of cold water turning into it, to temper it to what degree of warmth the bathers pleased to have.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

Adrianople,"Edirne, Turkey",41.6771,26.5557,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1717,"I AM at this present moment writing in a house situated on the banks of the Hebrus, which runs under my chamber window. My garden is full of all cypress trees, upon the branches of which several couple of true turtles are saying soft things to one another from morning till night. ... The summer is already far advanced in this part of the world; and, for some miles round Adrianople, the whole ground is laid out in gardens, and the banks of the rivers are set with rows of fruit-trees, under which all the most considerable Turks divert themselves every evening, not with walking, that is not one of their pleasures; but a set party of them chuse out a green spot, where the shade is very thick, and, there they spread a carpet, on which they sit drinking their coffee, and are generally attended by some slave with a fine voice, or that plays on some instrument.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

Adrianople ,"Edirne, Turkey",41.6771,26.5557,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1718,"The town is said to be eight miles in compass, I suppose they reckon in the gardens. There are some good houses in it, I mean large ones; for the architecture of their palaces never makes any great shew. It is now very full of people; but they are most of them such as follow the court, or camp; and when they are removed, I am told, 'tis no populous city. The river Maritza (anciently the Hebrus) on which it is situated, is dried up every summer, which contributes very much to make it unwholesome. It is now a very pleasant stream. There are two noble bridges built over it. ... But the pavement is kept much neater; and the shops are all so clean, they seem just new painted. ... This copious subject has drawn me from my description of the exchange, founded by Ali Bassa, whose name it bears. Near it is the sherski, a street of a mile in length, full of shops of all kind of fine merchandise, but excessive dear, nothing being made here. It is covered on the top with boards, to keep out the rain, that merchants may meet conveniently in all weathers.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

Constantinople,"Istanbul, Turkey",41.0082,28.9784,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1718,"WE arrived the next day at Constantinople; but I can yet tell you very little of it, all my time having been taken up with receiving visits, which are, at least, a very good entertainment to the eyes, the young women being all beauties, and their beauty highly improved by the high taste of their dress. Our palace is in Pera, which is no more a suburb of Constantinople, than Westminster is a suburb to London. All the ambassadors are lodged very near each other. One part of our house shews us the port, the city, and the seraglio, and the distant hills of Asia; perhaps, all together, the most beautiful prospect in the world.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

Belgrade Village ,"Belgrade Forest, Turkey",41.19431,28.95138,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1718,"The heats of Constantinople have driven me to this place, which perfectly answers the description of the Elysian fields. I am in the middle of a wood, consisting chiefly of fruit-trees, watered by a vast number of fountains, famous for the excellency of their water, and divided into many shady walks, upon short grass, that seems to me artificial, but, I am assured, is the pure work of nature—within view of the Black sea, from whence we perpetually enjoy the refreshment of cool breezes, that make us insensible of the heat of the summer. The village is only inhabited by the richest amongst the Christians, who meet every night at a fountain, forty paces from my house, to sing and dance.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

Pera of Constantinople,"Beyoğlu, Istanbul, Turkey",41.036944,28.9775,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1718,"The Asian side is covered with fruit-trees, villages, and the most delightful landskips in nature; on the European, stands Constantinople, situated on seven hills.—The unequal heights make it seem as large again as it is, (though one of the largest cities in the world) shewing an agreeable mixture of gardens, pine and cypress-trees, palaces, mosques, and public buildings, raised one above another, with as much beauty and appearance of symmetry, as your ladyship ever saw in a cabinet, adorned by the most skilful hands, where jars shew themselves above jars, mixed with canisters, babies and candlesticks. ... It is on a point of land running into the sea; a palace of prodigious extent, but very irregular. The gardens take in a large compass of ground, full of high cypress-trees, which is all I know of them. The buildings are all of white stone, leaded on the top, with gilded turrets and spires, which look very magnificent; and, indeed, I believe there is no Christian-king's palace half so large. There are six large courts in it, all built round, and set with trees, having galleries of stone; one of these for the guard, another for the slaves, another for the officers of the kitchen, another for the stables, the fifth for the divan, and the sixth for the apartment destined for audiences. On the ladies side, there are, at least, as many more, with distinct courts belonging to their eunuchs and attendants, their kitchens, &c.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

"Cape Janizary, promontory of Sigaeum, about a league past the burial place of Hecuba","Cape Gallipoli, Turkey",40.098,26.255,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1718,"Not many leagues sail from hence, I saw the point of land where poor old Hecuba was buried, and about a league from that place is Cape Janizary, the famous promontory of Sigaeum, where we anchored. My curiosity supplied me with strength to climb to the top of it, to see the place where Achilles was buried, and where Alexander ran naked round his tomb, in honour of him, which, no doubt, was a great comfort to his ghost. I saw there the ruins of a very large city, and found a stone, on which Mr W——y plainly distinguished the words of Sigaen Polin. ... WE saw very plainly from this promontory, the river Simois rolling from mount Ida, and running through a very spacious valley. It is now a considerable river, and is called Simores, it is joined in the vale by the Scamander, which appeared a small stream half choaked with mud, but is perhaps large in the winter. This was Xanthus amongst the gods, as Homer tells us; and 'tis by that heavenly name, the nymph Oenone invokes it, in her epistle to Paris. The Trojan virgins used to offer their first favours to it, by the name of Scamander, till the adventure, which Monsieur de la Fontaine has told so agreeably, abolish'd that heathenish ceremony. When the stream is mingled with the Simois, they run together to the sea.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

Carthage,"Carthage, Tunisia",36.8529,10.3217,Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1718,"I went up the little hill where once stood the castle of Byrsa, and from thence I had a distinct view of the situation of the famous city of Carthage, which stood on an isthmus, the sea coming on each side of it. 'Tis now a marshy ground on one side, where there are salt ponds. Strabo calls Carthage forty miles in circumference. There are now no remains of it, but what I have described; and the history of it is too well known to want my abridgement of it.","Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady M——Y W——Y M——E; Written During Her Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, New (London: Printed for Thomas Martin, 1890), Let.

All the admirals and captains of the men of war, full dressed, and in their barges, well ornamented with pendants, came alongside of the Namur. The vice-admiral then went on shore in his barge, followed by the other officers in order of seniority, to take possession, as I suppose, of the town and fort. Some time after this the French governor and his lady, and other persons of note, came on board our ship to dine.

I had often heard of some wonders that were to be seen on this hill, and I went once with some white and black people to visit it.

I had taken some potatoes with me, and I put them into different ponds, and in a few minutes they were well boiled.

"Cape Fear River, North Carolina","Cape Fear River, North Carolina",34.1869,-77.96357,Alexander Schaw,1775,"IN the province of North Carolina there are several rivers, which run a considerable way into the country. Upon the south is Cape Fear river, which is navigable for ships of large burden as far as a shoal which they call the Flats, about seven miles above Brunswick town, which is situated twelve miles within the bar. In consequence of this impediment, vessels which have a draught of above nine and a half feet of water cannot go up to Wilmington, which is the next port above and the most considerable town on the river, even at spring tides, till they are lightened to that draught. Above, or rather at Wil- mington, the Northeast and Northwest branches of the river join. The Northwest is the least considerable, and upon the whole extent there is no town, tho' its banks are very well settled. The first town is Cross Creek, about 100 miles above Wilmington. Here the whole trade with the back settlers is carried on for a great way round.

From Brunswick to Wilmington there are two roads: one goes up the right side of the river upon which Brunswick stands and crosses two ferries opposite to Wilmington, occasioned by the river being there divided by a large swampy island, through which there is a very bad road of a mile and a half. The length of this road is reckoned sixteen miles. To go by the other road, one must cross a ferry at Brunswick of a mile over, from whence to Wilming-ton it is about ten miles. Every part of these roads is more or less sandy. Some of them for miles together is very deep, as the surface often is a pure white sand, without a particle of soil to bind it together. This is the case with almost every part of the province near the sea.","Janet Schaw, Journal of a Lady of Quality; Being the Narrative of a Journey from Scotland to the West Indies,  North Carolina, and Portugal, in the Years 1774 to 1776, ed.

Wherever the land is dry, there is little or no brush. The woods in general are in the style of open groves in England, except in such places as have once been cleared and afterwards abandoned. These are always covered with brush. The roads upon the Northwest branch of the river grow more solid every mile above Wilmington, and long before they reach Cross Creek are very hard. The only making they bestow upon the roads in the flat part of the country is cutting out the trees to the necessary breadth, in as even a line as they can, and where the ground is wet, they make a small ditch on either side. The roads through swamp land are made by first laying logs in the direction of the road and covering them cross ways with small pine trees, layd regularly together over sod, with which the logs are previously covered.

The Mountains between which we passed, great part whereof are steep Rocks, were pretty full of Shrubs : We found some also in the Valleys, but none of any tolerable Bigness, neither did we see any tilled Land, tho’ there were many small Meadows on the Bank-side, abounding with excellent Pasture. The Air was very mild all the Morning ; but as soon as we enter’d among the last Mountains, we found a pretty strong North-west Wind, and towards Noon, when we began to encamp, we had some Drops of Rain, after which it became very hot, till there rose a high Wind at West North-west, which allayed the Heat.","J.-B.

"Octogon Tower, Hokhokol (or Korkokol) Plain","near Hohhot, Mongolia",40.83746,111.71931,"Jean-François Gerbillon, S.J.",1688,"This Plain is cultivated in many Places, and here and there are Hamlets of seven or eight little Houses of Earth. After we had travelled in it about 40 Li, we passed near a Tower, built, as they assured me, 400 Years ago : It is still pretty entire, except the Roof, which is ruinous, and the Foundation begins also to decay. It is a regular Octogon with eight Stories, each ol eleven Foot at least, besides the first, which exceeds fifteen without the Coping, so that the whole Height is 100 Foot. This Tower is all of Brick as white as Stone, and well built ; it is embellish’d with several Ornaments of Brick-Work, and a fort of Plaister laid thereon. Its Architecture is quite different from ours, and tho' a little rude, has its Beauty, and pleases the Eye : The first Story is round, and shaped like a Cup, adorn-ed with Foliages ; the rest have eight Fronts, in each of which are two Statues in Demi -Relief, near as big as the Life, but ill done. You go up to the first Story by a Ladder, and there the Staircafe begins. Here probably stood a City, or large Town, for there still remains a wide Compass of Mud Walls, which, tho’ more than half demolish’d, are entire enough to shew that the Tower was built by the Western Tartars , whilst they reign’d in China , under the Family of the Ywen.","J.-B.

The Soil consists of a firm Sand, mixed in some Places with a little Earth : The Country grew more and more desart and barren, affording no good Pasture for the Cat-tle and we saw but one Tree. About 40 Li from whence we fet out we found some Wells with a little Water, and some Grass about them: We saw several Herds of Deer, and Flocks of Partridges on the Plains, especially near the Place where we encamp’d, which was at the Foot of some Hillocks that bound the Plain.","J.-B.

Kalkas,"Inner Mongolia, China",41.85292,106.3314,"Jean-François Gerbillon, S.J.",1688,"we marched 65 Li to the North-west, all through great Plains interspersed here and there with little Eminences, and the Country more and more desart and barren, consisting almoft wholly of burning Sands sometimes firm and sometimes loose, without Tree, Water or Pastures. Just as we had decamp’d we found abundance of those Stones of Rock and Sand condensed, full of yellow Spangles, and glittering like Gold. We saw great Numbers of Deer in these Plains, three of which our People kill’d, and could have killed more if they had not been afraid of fatiguing their Horses. Partridges likewise are here in Plenty : We saw great Coveys between the Heights. Having passed the Hills we encamp’d in a small Plain, which being nothing but Sand, the Heat was intolerable. We had no Water but what we drew out of Pits ; and tho’ it was very good, yet as there was no Pasture, the Cattle suffer’d much. It was very hot all Day, only a little Wind stirred now and then : In the Evening, we had a great Storm, and another towards Midnight, with Rain and Thunder.","J.-B.

The Valleys which we crossed are full of good Forage, and watered, by Rivu-lets and the Lan ho, or the Kurkir : This last River rises in Mount Pe cha, and after running a confiderable Way S. W. and S. at the Rounding of these Mountains, falls into the Lan ho. We encamped by the Kurkir, in a Valley of good Forage, about three Quarters of a League wide. This River is every where fordable, like the Lan ho, and we crossed it several times in our way.","J.-B.

The Plain was for the most part stored with good Forage, and yet thin of Inhabitants. We encamped in a Place called Turghen iskar, on the Banks of a little River called Iskiar, which rises in Mount Pe cha, and having run for some time to the S.W. falls into the Lan ho. This latter rises in the same Mountain, and after it has run first W. next S.W. and then S. returns at length to the E. and S.E. and being enlarged with several other Streams, empties it-self into the Eastern Sea.

South of the Pagod are the Ruins of a little House, and to the North you meet with a Grotto, in which you see the Remains of a Chapel, on whose Walls several Images are still standing ; in it were two old broken Coffers, full of Writings in the Mongol Language, and in two others, which I am unacquainted with.","J.-B.

After we had gone about 40 Li, we passed between two Pools, whose Water was so bad that the Ambassadors resolved to go on to the Place where we pitched, called Holostay pulak, on little Hills, where is a Spring of a very good Taste, which waters a Valley that afforded the best Forage we had yet met with.

Not far from the Place where we crossed it the Plain grows narrower, and we entered among the Mountains, which at first are covered with nothing but Grass, but about 30 Li beyond the Ri-ver they are full of Woods. Toward the top we observed a few Pines, but almost all the other Trees were of a Kind which I had not met with in Europe : It is called Wha shu by the Chinese , and does not grow to any great Height ; it resembles the Aspin Tree, and has, like it, a white Bark, of which the Chinese make Sheaths for Knives, and such like things.","J.-B.

E. till having passed the Point of the Mountain, (which was near our Camp, and lies due West from the Confluence of the little River Tirelki and the Tula) it turns directly West. It is considerably larger than the Kerlon , and its Stream exceeding clear, running over a Bottom of Flints and Pebbles. Its Banks are very agreeable, being covered with various Sorts of beautiful and bushy Trees. In its Course it forms several little Istes, full of most de-lightful GroveS, and we found a Coolness in the Air that was very refreshing in this hot Season. The River is very rapid, and on both Sides without the Trees is a Meadow abounding with excellent Fo-rage.
