    "Description":"All the streets are paved with broad stones, and before many of the meanest artificers doors are placed seats of various coloured marbles, so neatly kept, that, I assure you, I walked almost all over the town yesterday, _incognito_, in my slippers without receiving one spot of dirt; and you may see the Dutch maids washing the pavement of the street, with more application than ours do our bed-chambers. The town seems so full of people, with such busy faces, all in motion, that I can hardly fancy it is not some celebrated fair; but I see it is every day the same. 'Tis certain no town can be more advantageously situated for commerce. Here are seven large canals, on which the merchants ships come up to the very doors of their houses. The shops and warehouses are of a surprising neatness and magnificence, filled with an incredible quantity of fine merchandise, and so much cheaper than what we see in England, that I have much ado to persuade myself I am still so near it. Here is neither dirt nor beggary to be seen. One is not shocked with those loathsome cripples, so common in London, nor teased with the importunity of idle fellows and wenches, that chuse (sic) to be nasty and lazy. The common servants, and little shop-women, here, are more nicely clean than most of our ladies; and the great variety of neat dresses (every woman dressing her head after her own fashion) is an additional pleasure in seeing the town.",

The whole country appears a large garden; the roads are well paved, shaded on each side with rows of trees, and bordered with large canals, full of boats, passing and repassing. Every twenty paces gives you the prospect of some villa, and every four hours that of a large town, so surprisingly neat, I am sure you would be charmed with them. The place I am now at is certainly one of the finest villages in the world. Here are several squares finely built, and (what I think a particular beauty) the whole set with thick large trees. The _Vour-hout_ is, at the same time, the Hyde-Park and Mall of the people of quality; for they take the air in it both on foot and in coaches. There are shops for wafers, cool liquors, &c.--I have been to see several of the most celebrated gardens, but I will not teaze (sic) you with their descriptions.",

    "Description":"If you were with me in this town, you would be ready to expect to receive visits from your Nottingham friends. No two places were ever more resembling; one has but to give the Maese the name of the Trent, and there is no distinguishing the prospect. The houses, like those of Nottingham, are built one above another, and are intermixed in the same manner with trees and gardens. The tower they call Julius Caesar's, has the same situation with Nottingham castle; and I cannot help fancying, I see from it the Trentfield, Adboulton, places so well known to us. 'Tis true, the fortifications make a considerable difference. All the learned in the art of war bestow great commendations on them; for my part, that know nothing of the matter, I shall content myself with telling you, 'tis a very pretty walk on the ramparts, on which there is a tower, very deservedly called the Belvidera; where people go to drink coffee, tea, &c. and enjoy one of the finest prospects in the world. The public walks have no great beauty but the thick shade of the trees, which is solemnly delightful. But I must not forget to take notice of the bridge, which appeared very surprising to me. It is large enough to hold hundreds of men, with horses and carriages. They give the value of an English two-pence to get upon it, and then away they go, bridge and all, to the other side of the river, with so slow a motion, one is hardly sensible of any at all. I was yesterday at the French church, and stared very much at their manner of service. The parson clapped on a broad-brimmed hat in the first place, which gave him entirely the air of _what d'ye call him_, in Bartholomew fair, which he kept up by extraordinary antic gestures, and preaching much such stuff as the other talked to the puppets. However, the congregation seemed to receive it with great devotion; and I was informed by some of his flock, that he is a person of particular fame amongst them.",

This is a very large town, but the most part of it is old built. The Jesuits church, which is the neatest, was shewed (sic) me, in a very complaisant manner, by a handsome young Jesuit; who, not knowing who I was, took a liberty in his compliments and railleries, which very much diverted me. Having never before seen any thing of that nature, I could not enough admire the magnificence of the altars, the rich images of the saints (all massy silver) and the _enchassures_ of the relicks (sic); though I could not help murmuring, in my heart, at the profusion of pearls, diamonds, and rubies, bestowed on the adornment of rotten teeth, and dirty rags. I own that I had wickedness enough to covet St Ursula's pearl necklaces; though perhaps this was no wickedness at all, an image not being certainly one's neighbour's; but I went yet farther, and wished the wench herself converted into dressing-plate. I should also gladly see converted into silver, a great St Christopher, which I imagine would look very well in a cistern.",

'Tis impossible not to observe the difference between the free towns and those under the government of absolute princes, as all the little sovereigns of Germany are. In the first, there appears an air of commerce and plenty. The streets are well-built, and full of people, neatly and plainly dressed. The shops are loaded with merchandise, and the commonalty are clean and cheerful. In the other you see a sort of shabby finery, a number of dirty people of quality tawdered (sic) out; narrow nasty streets out of repair, wretchedly thin of inhabitants, and above half of the common sort asking alms.",

    "Description":"This town, which has the honour of being the emperor's residence, did not at all answer my expectation, nor ideas of it, being much less than I expected to find it; the streets are very close, and so narrow, one cannot observe the fine fronts of the palaces, though many of them very well deserve observation, being truly magnificent. They are built of fine white stone, and are excessive high. For as the town is too little for the number of the people that desire to live in it, the builders seem to have projected to repair that misfortune, by clapping one town on the top of another, most of the houses being of five, and some of them six stories. You may easily imagine, that the streets being so narrow, the rooms are extremely dark; and, what is an inconveniency much more intolerable, in my opinion, there is no house has so few as five or six families in it. The apartments of the greatest ladies, and even of the ministers of state, are divided, but by a partition, from that of a taylor (sic) or shoemaker; and I know no body that has above two floors in any house, one for their own use, and one higher for their servants. Those that have houses of their own, let Out the rest of them to whoever will take them; and thus the great stairs, (which are all of stone) are as common and as dirty as the street. 'Tis true, when you have once travelled through them, nothing can be more surprisingly magnificent than the apartments. They are commonly a _suite_ of eight or ten large rooms, all inlaid, the doors and windows richly carved and gilt, and the furniture, such as is seldom seen in the palaces of sovereign princes in other countries. Their apartments are adorned with hangings of the finest tapestry of Brussels, prodigious large looking glasses in silver frames, fine japan tables, beds, chairs, canopies, and window curtains of the richest Genoa damask or velvet, almost covered with gold lace or embroidery. All this is made gay by pictures, and vast jars of japan china, and large lustres of rock crystal.",

The opera house, which was built by the late elector, is much finer than that of Vienna. I was very sorry that the ill weather did not permit me to see Hernhausen in all its beauty; but in spite of the snow, I thought the gardens very fine. I was particularly surprised at the vast number of orange trees, much larger than any I have ever seen in England, though this climate is certainly colder. But I had more reason to wonder that night at the king's table, to see a present from a gentleman of this country, of two large baskets full of ripe oranges and lemons of different sorts, many of which were quite new to me; and what I thought worth all the rest, two ripe ananasses (sic), which, to my taste, are a fruit perfectly delicious. You know they are naturally the growth of Brazil, and I could not imagine how they came here, but by enchantment. Upon inquiry, I learnt that they have brought their stoves to such perfection, they lengthen their summer as long as they please, giving to every plant the degree of heat it would receive from the sun in its native soil. The effect is very near the same; I am surprised we do not practise (sic) in England so useful an invention. This reflection leads me to consider our obstinacy in shaking with cold, five months in the year rather than make use of stoves, which are certainly one of the greatest conveniencies (sic) of life. Besides, they are so far from spoiling the form of a room, that they add very much to the magnificence of it, when they are painted and gilt, as they are at Vienna, or at Dresden, where they are often in the shapes of china jars, statues, or fine cabinets, so naturally represented, that they are not to be distinguished.",

    "Description":"We continued two days travelling between this place and Buda, through the finest plains in the world, as even as if they were paved, and extremely fruitful; but for the most part desert and uncultivated, laid waste by the long wars between the Turk and the Emperor; and the more cruel civil war, occasioned by the barbarous persecution of the protestant religion by the emperor Leopold. That prince has left behind him the character of an extraordinary piety, and was naturally of a mild merciful temper; but, putting his conscience into the hands of a Jesuit, he was more cruel and treacherous to his poor Hungarian subjects, than ever the Turk has been to the Christians; breaking, without scruple his coronation oath, and his faith, solemnly given in many public treaties. Indeed, nothing can be more melancholy than in travelling through Hungary, to reflect on the former flourishing state of that kingdom, and to see such a noble spot of earth almost uninhabited. Such are also the present circumstances of Buda (where we arrived very early the twenty-second) once the royal seat of the Hungarian kings, whose palace was reckoned one of the most beautiful buildings of the age, now wholly destroyed, no part of the town having been repaired since the last siege, but the fortifications and the castle, which is the present residence of the governor general Ragule, an officer of great merit. He came immediately to see us, and carried us in his coach to his house, where I was received by his lady with all possible civility, and magnificently entertained. This city is situated upon a little hill on the south side of the Danube. The castle is much higher than the town, and from it the prospect is very noble. Without the walls ly (sic) a vast number of little houses, or rather huts, that they call the Rascian town, being altogether inhabited by that people. The governor assured me, it would furnish twelve thousand fighting men. These towns look very odd; their houses stand in rows, many thousands of them so close together, that they appear, at a little distance, like old-fashioned thatched tents. They consist, every one of them, of one hovel above, and another under ground; these are their summer and winter apartments. Buda was first taken by Solyman the Magnificent, in 1526, and lost the following year to Ferdinand I, king of Bohemia. Solyman regained it by the treachery of the garrison, and voluntarily gave it into the hands of king John of Hungary; after whose death, his son being an infant, Ferdinand laid siege to it, and the queen mother was forced to call Solyman to her aid. He indeed raised the siege, but left a Turkish garrison in the town, and commanded her to remove her court from thence, which she was forced to submit to, in 1541. It resisted afterwards the sieges laid to it by the marquis of Brandenburg, in the year 1542; count Schwartzenburg, in 1598; General Rosworm, in 1602; and the duke of Lorrain, commander of the emperor's forces, in 1684, to whom it yielded, in 1686, after an obstinate defence, Apti Bassa, the governor, being killed, fighting in the breach with a Roman bravery. The loss of this town was so important, and so much resented by the Turks, that it occasioned the deposing of their emperor Mahomet IV. the year following.",

This battle opened the first passage for the Turks into the heart of Hungary.--I don't name to you the little villages, of which I can say nothing remarkable; but I'll assure you, I have always found a warm stove, and great plenty, particularly of wild boar, venison, and all kinds of _gibier_. The few people that inhabit Hungary, live easily enough; they have no money, but the woods and plains afford them provision in great abundance; they were ordered to give us all things necessary, even what horses we pleased to demand, _gratis_; but Mr W----y would not oppress the poor country people, by making use of this order, and always paid them to the full worth of what we had. They were so surprised at this unexpected generosity, which they are very little used to, that they always pressed upon us, at parting, a dozen of fat pheasants, or something of that sort, for a present.",

This we found but too true, the woods being very dangerous, and scarce passable, from the vast quantity of wolves that hoard in them. We came, however, safe, though late to Essek, where we stayed a day, to dispatch a courier with letters to the bassa of Belgrade; and I took that opportunity of seeing the town, which is not very large, but fair built, and well fortified. This was a town of great trade, very rich and populous, when in the hands of the Turks. It is situated on the Drave, which runs into the Danube. The bridge was esteemed one of the most extraordinary in the world, being eight thousand paces long, and all built of oak. It was burnt, and the city laid in ashes by count Lesly, 1685, but was again repaired and fortified by the Turks, who, however, abandoned it in 1687. General Dunnewalt then took possession of it for the emperor, in whose hands it has remained ever since, and is esteemed one of the bulwarks of Hungary.",

It was first taken by Solyman the Magnificent, and since by the emperor's forces, led by the elector of Bavaria. The emperor held it only two Years, it being retaken by the grand vizier. It is now fortified with the utmost care and skill the Turks are capable of, and strengthened by a very numerous garrison of their bravest janizaries, commanded by a bassa seraskier (i.e. general) though this last expression is not very just; for, to say truth, the seraskier is commanded by the janizaries. These troops have an absolute authority here, and their conduct carries much more the aspect of rebellion, than the appearance of subordination.",

The next room is a very large one paved with marble, and all round it are two raised sofas of marble, one above another. There were four fountains of cold water in this room, falling first into marble basons, and then running on the floor in little channels made for that purpose, which carried the streams into the next room, something less than this, with the same sort of marble sofas, but so hot with steams of sulphur proceeding from the baths joining to it, 'twas impossible to stay there with one's cloathson.

The buildings are all of white stone, leaded on the top, with gilded turrets and spires, which look very magnificent; and, indeed, I believe there is no Christian-king's palace half so large. There are six large courts in it, all built round, and set with trees, having galleries of stone; one of these for the guard, another for the slaves, another for the officers of the kitchen, another for the stables, the fifth for the divan, and the sixth for the apartment destined for audiences. On the ladies side, there are, at least, as many more, with distinct courts belonging to their eunuchs and attendants, their kitchens, &c.",

My curiosity supplied me with strength to climb to the top of it, to see the place where Achilles was buried, and where Alexander ran naked round his tomb, in honour of him, which, no doubt, was a great comfort to his ghost. I saw there the ruins of a very large city, and found a stone, on which Mr W——y plainly distinguished the words of Sigaen Polin. ... WE saw very plainly from this promontory, the river Simois rolling from mount Ida, and running through a very spacious valley. It is now a considerable river, and is called Simores, it is joined in the vale by the Scamander, which appeared a small stream half choaked with mud, but is perhaps large in the winter. This was Xanthus amongst the gods, as Homer tells us; and 'tis by that heavenly name, the nymph Oenone invokes it, in her epistle to Paris. The Trojan virgins used to offer their first favours to it, by the name of Scamander, till the adventure, which Monsieur de la Fontaine has told so agreeably, abolish'd that heathenish ceremony. When the stream is mingled with the Simois, they run together to the sea.",

But the large fieldes of the subu-rbes haue deceyued many, beyng dispersed with in maner in-numerable villages, which some haue thought to haue been part of the citie, whiche is nothyng so.

This they did with such effect, that one day I saw some of the ships set on fire by the shells from the batteries, and I believe two or three of them were quite burnt... At last Louisbourgh was taken, and the English men of war came into the harbour before it, to my very great joy; for I had now more liberty of indulging myself, and I went often on shore. When the ships were in the harbour we had the most beautiful procession on the water I ever saw. All the admirals and captains of the men of war, full dressed, and in their barges, well ornamented with pendants, came alongside of the Namur. The vice-admiral then went on shore in his barge, followed by the other officers in order of seniority, to take possession, as I suppose, of the town and fort. Some time after this the French governor and his lady, and other persons of note, came on board our ship to dine. On this occasion our ships were dressed with colours of all kinds, from the topgallant-mast head to the deck; and this, with the firing of guns, formed a most grand and magnificent spectacle.",

Here I spent my time very pleasantly; I was much on shore all about this delightful island, and found the inhabitants very civil.",

I had often heard of some wonders that were to be seen on this hill, and I went once with some white and black people to visit it. When we arrived at the top, I saw under different cliffs great flakes of brimstone, occasioned by the steams of various little ponds, which were then boiling naturally in the earth. Some of these ponds were as white as milk, some quite blue, and many others of different colours. I had taken some potatoes with me, and I put them into different ponds, and in a few minutes they were well boiled. I tasted some of them, but they were very sulphurous; and the silver shoe buckles, and all the other things of that metal we had among us, were, in a little time, turned as black as lead.",

Within our view was one very well-looking house, which, we were told, belongs to the proprietor of the Island ; and at a little distance, a town composed of hutts with a church. I observed several stack-yards, but neither a tree nor a shrub.",

In the centre is a large extensive plane, surrounded with hills in form of an Amphitheatre; the ground rises by an easy ascent all the way from the shore, and in the bosom of the hills stands a very noble house, round which is a great deal of fine laid out policy. It fronts the shore, and is entirely open to the Sea, and tho' the Island is evidently under the power of winter, the beauty of the Verdure is inconceivable ; and when the Vines, which are now leafless and cut down, are in foliage and fruit, it is certainly a garden that, had our first parents been sent to repent in, they would soon have forgot their native Eden. The hills behind the plane were covered with pasture or Vineyard, and we observed forts on two of them, but no other house of any note, tho' some hamlets were scattered here and there, and \nwhat we took to be Orange groves by the figure of the tree.",

We had the Island on both sides of us, yet its beauties were different, the one was hills, dales and groves, and not a tree, plant or shrub I had ever seen before; the ground is vastly uneven, \nbut not very high ; the sugar canes cover the hills almost to the top, and bear a resemblance in colour at least to a rich field of green wheat ; the hills are skirted by the Palmetto or Cabbage tree, which even from this distance makes a noble appearance. The houses are generally placed in the Valleys between the hills, and all front to the sea. We saw many fine ones. There were also some fine walks along the Shore shaded by different trees, of which I am yet ignorant.",

From our situation we had an extensive prospect of that side of the Island, which lay next us, which tho' very beautiful is different from the first view we had of Antigua, which rises on you by degrees.

The evening was fine, the sun gilding the horizon and giving additional beauty to the green hills. The sky was placid and serene above fifty ships were lying at Anchor, and above a hundred boats en-gaged in the sardine fishing and chanting Vespers. The town was full in prospect and many windmills going above it, which I think a very cheerful object. The coast is extremely bold and the hills and high grounds, covered with wheat or pasture, looked so fresh that they perfectly cheered the senses.",

In consequence of this impediment, vessels which have a draught of above nine and a half feet of water cannot go up to Wilmington, which is the next port above and the most considerable town on the river, even at spring tides, till they are lightened to that draught. Above, or rather at Wil- mington, the Northeast and Northwest branches of the river join. The Northwest is the least considerable, and upon the whole extent there is no town, tho' its banks are very well settled. The first town is Cross Creek, about 100 miles above Wilmington. Here the whole trade with the back settlers is carried on for a great way round.\n",

From Brunswick to Wilmington there are two roads: one goes up the right side of the river upon which Brunswick stands and crosses two ferries opposite to Wilmington, occasioned by the river being there divided by a large swampy island, through which there is a very bad road of a mile and a half. The length of this road is reckoned sixteen miles. To go by the other road, one must cross a ferry at Brunswick of a mile over, from whence to Wilming-ton it is about ten miles. Every part of these roads is more or less sandy. Some of them for miles together is very deep, as the surface often is a pure white sand, without a particle of soil to bind it together.

The woods in general are in the style of open groves in England, except in such places as have once been cleared and afterwards abandoned. These are always covered with brush. The roads upon the Northwest branch of the river grow more solid every mile above Wilmington, and long before they reach Cross Creek are very hard. The only making they bestow upon the roads in the flat part of the country is cutting out the trees to the necessary breadth, in as even a line as they can, and where the ground is wet, they make a small ditch on either side. The roads through swamp land are made by first laying logs in the direction of the road and covering them cross ways with small pine trees, layd regularly together over sod, with which the logs are previously covered.",

At low water there is ten feet of water upon the bar; at spring tides there is from 19 to 20 feet, so that in fine weather ships of deeper draught can easily go in.

From East to the Mountains beyond the Great Wall it is about 100 Leagues, not comprehending the Mountains to the North of the Great Wall ; for tho they are in a manner uninhabited the Soil is good, there are fine Pastures, Woods, Sprint, and Rivulets of good Water in abundance. Nor do I take in the Country beyond the Kerlon, abounding with Water and Pasturage, tho thinly inhabited, especially the Western Part. The Desart is much larger from North to South, and above 100 Leagues over, in some Parts quite bare, without Trees, Grass, or Water except some Ponds and Marshes made by the Rains, and here and there a Well of Water bad enough.",

It is a regular Octogon with eight Stories, each ol eleven Foot at least, besides the first, which exceeds fifteen without the Coping, so that the whole Height is 100 Foot. This Tower is all of Brick as white as Stone, and well built ; it is embellish’d with several Ornaments of Brick-Work, and a fort of Plaister laid thereon. Its Architecture is quite different from ours, and tho' a little rude, has its Beauty, and pleases the Eye : The first Story is round, and shaped like a Cup, adorn-ed with Foliages ; the rest have eight Fronts, in each of which are two Statues in Demi -Relief, near as big as the Life, but ill done. You go up to the first Story by a Ladder, and there the Staircafe begins. Here probably stood a City, or large Town, for there still remains a wide Compass of Mud Walls, which, tho’ more than half demolish’d, are entire enough to shew that the Tower was built by the Western Tartars , whilst they reign’d in China , under the Family of the Ywen.",

E. till having passed the Point of the Mountain, (which was near our Camp, and lies due West from the Confluence of the little River Tirelki and the Tula) it turns directly West. It is considerably larger than the Kerlon , and its Stream exceeding clear, running over a Bottom of Flints and Pebbles. Its Banks are very agreeable, being covered with various Sorts of beautiful and bushy Trees. In its Course it forms several little Istes, full of most de-lightful GroveS, and we found a Coolness in the Air that was very refreshing in this hot Season. The River is very rapid, and on both Sides without the Trees is a Meadow abounding with excellent Fo-rage. This is certainly the most agreeable Place I had seen in all my Travels into Tartary.",

There are three mosques (jámí) and seven mesjids, three kháns, one bath, two schools for boys, and two hundred small streets; but no room for reading the Korán or tradition, because the greater number of the inhabitants are Greeks. There are fine gardens producing superior figs and grapes. From the excellence of its vinegar, it has acquired the name of Dárkhill (vinegar-house). South-east of the town we passed on horseback continuously through gardens and the cultivated field called Filehdár. The river Nílúfer, not fordable in the beginning of spring, is a clear stream, which issuing from the mountains Rúhbán, Ketelí and Castel, waters the valley of Fillehdár and disembogues into the White Sea. The main road crosses it over a handsome bridge, each arch of which resembles the arch of heaven...",

It is so steep and prominent that the great mosque, the castle and bezestán of Brússa seem as it were sinking into the base of the mountain, and from the summit cannot be seen at all. Rocks towering to the sky take the appearance here of many strange shapes, such as dragons, elephants and eagles. We mounted still further in the direction of the Kiblah through flowery meadows, where no tall trees were to be seen, and after five hours came to the station of Sultán Suleïmán’s fountain-head. A delightful spot with a spring of water so cold that a man cannot take out of it three stones in succession.

It is said that Alexander the Great, when commanded by God to build the wall of Gog and Magog, arrived at this place, he was so much pleased with its air and situation, that he built here a pentagon castle of immense stones (Shedádí, Cyclopean); the room of the diván was paved with rubies, emeralds, turquoises and cornelians, and for that reason was called the Castle Kevherpaí Anapaí. It afterwards fell into the hands of the Genoese, and when Timúr laid waste the towns of Dadián, Heshdek, and other towns amounting altogether to the number of seven hundred, in his expedition against Tokhatmish the Lord of Crimea, he also wasted the suburbs of the castle of Anapa, but the castle itself was spared. In the reign of Sultán Bayazíd II., the great Vezír Gedek Ahmed Páshá, leading the expedition against Kaffa, took this castle also from the Genoese, and put troops into it. It is situated at the extremity of the Cape which divides the territory of the Abáza from Circassia, on a clay cliff; it is a strong castle without a garrison, and has been several times ransacked by the Cossacks of the Tanais. Outside of the castle are one hundred and fifty houses built of reed; this village is called Kabák. North of the castle are the mountains of Anapa. The ships which go to Assov sail past these mountains, which extend as far as the Cossacks of Assov. The castle of Anapa is well built, and in such good preservation, that it appears as if it had just come out of the hands of the builder.",

The windows of the Convent, and of the monument, all look towards the sea. The magnificent kitchen like that of Keikavús is worth seeing; day and night the fire is kept up on the stove for passengers and strangers, they have no endowments but live on alms; they are all purified by mystic divine love. To the right and left of the mountain are many wells in the rocks. The rocks being perpendicular like those of Mount Bisútún are excavated at the base. The projecting rocks are so lofty that ships with topmasts an hundred yards high may enter here, and come to an anchor. The masters of these ships take in barley and wheat which is brought in waggons to the mouths of the aforesaid shafts which are cut in the rock, and poured down them into the holds; these shafts were cut in ancient times by Infidel stonecutters, who were like so many Ferháds; and it is a peculiar sight not to be seen elsewhere, and saves a circuit of between three and four hours in bringing the barley to the foot of the rock. There are no such high and dreary rocks any where in the Black Sea. During southernly and easternly gales, the sea produces a roaring in the excavations, which is heard as far as Iflatár and Ilhánlar near Silistra, a day’s journey from hence. On the top of these rocks are nests of eagles each as large as a sheep, they are even killed and eaten by some for mutton.",

On the borders of the lake there are melons and water-melons of such a size that two make an ass-load. On the lake are from seventy to eighty kaiks and boats, which are employed in the passage from village to village, and for the transport of wood. There are a great number of most delicious fish. Its depth is twenty fathoms, the water is clear and brilliant, and excellent for washing without soap. It is this water which gives a whiteness resembling cotton to the bread Súmúní. On the east side of the lake, at two hours distance, passes the river Sakaria, which disembogues into the Black Sea in the province of Koja Ilí at the place called Irva; it would require but little spirit of enterprise to unite the lake with the sea, by means of this river, a branch of which goes down to the salt-marshes of Nicomedia. As early as the reign of Mohammed III. a great number of workmen were employed in establishing a communication between the gulf of Nicomedia and the lake of Sabánja, but the undertaking was given up at the request of the inhabitants. If the Sakaria were united with this lake, and the lake with the gulf of Nicomedia, this town would be quite an inland port; the timber and wood might be brought down to Bolí, and it would cost no more than five aspers the quintal. God make it easy!\nWe marched to the eastward six hours, along the seashore, through thick forests, called “Ocean of trees,” and crossed the Sakaria by a wooden bridge; this river issues from the mountain Chifteler, passes through Koja Ilí, and goes into the Black Sea near Irva.",

Its source is at the bottom of the pilgrimage of Dúmlibaba, on the east side of Georgia; it flows towards the west, causing in its way many marshes and canals, passes before the village of Kián, the castle of Kemáni, through the Yaila of a thousand lakes, inhabited by the Curds Izúlí, joins the Murád (the name of which it assumes), and passes like a sea in the neighbourhood of Malatia to Samosat, Kala’aí Rúm, Birejík, the bridge Búmbúja, Bálissa, Ja’aber, Rakie, Rahbie, Karkessia, Ania, Hita, Ebyár, Takúk, Helle, and Kúfa; it is joined at Kaverna by the Shatt-ul-arab (Tigris), and thus becomes an immensely large river, which is ascended by Indian ships from Bassra; the whole extent, with all its windings, is four hundred farsangs; it passes four hundred towns and villages. In the plain of Erzerúm its water is very sweet and palatable... The Euphrates freezes in the winter so that during two months many caravans cross it, but it never freezes south of Erzerúm; it is a sweet clear water, and a great comfort to the inhabitants of Erzerúm, though they have the spring, called the Source of Paradise, within their walls.",

The first, which is the Georgian gate (Gúrji), is double, like that of Erzenján; but that of Tabríz, as it is close to the walls of the inner castle, is only a single one. The guns are all pointed towards the quarters of the town Dáragháj and Gumishlí Kunbed. Within the outer castle is an immense tower reaching to the skies, known by the name of Kessik Kulle, on the top of which is a high wooden Koshk; as it is one hundred cubits high, ten guns pointed from thence in all directions, intercept even the flight of birds. The height of the wall of the inner castle is seventy cubits; the other walls are but from forty to fifty cubits high; there are two hundred and ten strong towers, and two thousand and eighty battlements round the castle, and seventeen hundred houses, all covered with earth (terrasses) in the ancient style, so also are all the villages which I saw in the whole government of Erzerúm.",

The third builder of Tabríz was Húlagú, who resided here seven years, and embellished it wonderfully: Mohammed Khodabende Ibzárgún Sháh transferred the whole palace, built by Húlagú, on camels to his new built town. The timber used in the buildings was all cypress and aloe wood, and they have been faced with china ever since. The fourth builder was Mohammed Sháh Ghazán, who extended the boundaries to the mountains of Senján, Aján, and Sehlán, and surrounded it with a wall, which required four days to make a tour of it. The town formerly built by Motevekel became then the inner castle or citadel of the new town. In the year 959, it was taken by Sultán Suleimán, who did not ravage it, but made a present of it to Sháh Elkáss Mirza.",

It has three iron gates; to the south, the gate of Tabríz; to the north, the gate of the Meidán called Yaila Kapússí, on this spot they play Maïl; to the west, the gate of the bridge; there are seven hundred cannons large and small, which remained from the time of the Ottomans, and an immense number of other stores, because it is the frontier of Azerbeiján. It is garrisoned by three thousand men of the fortress, three thousand men of the Khán, and seven thousand men of the province. Sometimes its Khán enjoyed the title of Khán of Kháns.

    "Description":"The Turkish general having convinced himself of the importance of the town of Aras, situated between Genje and Shirván, collected masons and workmen, and enclosed the town with a wall, including the garden Sháh Khiabán, which was outside of the town; three gates led through this wall of clay, the circumference of which is nine thousand six hundred paces. It was finished in forty days, and the governorship, with the rank of a Begler Beg, conferred on Kaitáss-Beg, who had been brought up in the Harím of Sultán Murad. From its situation at the foot of a mountain, the town resembles that of Brússa, surrounded with gardens of fruits and flowers, vineyards and rosebeds. It consists of ten thousand houses with terraces, and forty mosques; in the castle are those of Murad III., of Ferhád Páshá, and of Kara Sinán. The Turkomans and Komúks of Dághistán, pronounce the name of this town Arash. In the beginning of the reign of Sultán Mustafa, this town like that of Merend fell into the hands of the Persians. Forty quarters may now be reckoned, and as many mosques, sixteen baths, eight hundred shops, and seven coffee-houses.",

The town consists of about seven thousand well built houses, stone walls, and terraces, each house provided with water; there is an infinite number of gardens, and twenty-six quarters; the quarters called Meidán and Shabúrán being in the inner castle are the most elegant; there are seventy mosques, the oldest is that of Div Alí, who was one of the Kháns of Shah Tahmáss, but a Sunní; in the suburb is the great mosque of Sháh Safí, which rivals the vault of the palace of Chosroes. In the court-yard is a basin, and round it cells for students; the gates of the mosque of Ferhád Páshá are closed, because it has no endowment; the mosque of Uzdemír Osmán Páshá is a college, where the Muftí holds lectures: there is a dining establishment of Sultán Khodabende’s foundation, forty schools for boys, seven pleasant baths, the best of which is that of Shabúr, with numerous private rooms and a basin, its waiters are fine youths. Besides the public baths, there are private ones in every garden. There are forty caravánseraïs, in each of which many thousand tománs of wares are deposited. The public security is so great, that every man leaves his shop open, without the least danger, when he goes away on business; there are altogether twelve hundred shops. There is no Bezestán of stone, but nevertheless a great number of valuable articles; the coffee-houses are meeting-places for wits and learned men; the air is mild and the land fertile; rice, cotton, seven sorts of grapes, pears, and water-melons are in great perfection.",

    "Description":"Alexander closed this passage with an iron gate, which remained up to the time of Núshirván by whom it was renewed. Jezdejerd Sháh, Ismail Sháh and Uzdemír Páshá repaired the castle situated at the foot of mount Arghan and Deneb. The foundations of the western walls are washed by the Caspian Sea. The walls were built by Herzsháh, as is recorded by the Persian chronostick on the gate of the harbour. The remains of the wall of Alexander also, which was a broad thick wall, are still to be seen projecting from the Sea. If the government would undertake it, it would be easy to extend the harbour from these walls up to the fortress. The length of the wall from the sea to the high mountain is an arrow’s shot, and the breadth of the castle itself is the same. It is built in a pentagon form on a high hill, the strongest I ever saw during my travels; the intelligent architect distributed it into three parts, one of which looks eastward to mount Safah; the second gate is the entrance to the town. In the wall which looks to Mount Arghan are also two gates, and two others leading to the lower town; the first is called Meskúr because it opens towards the district of that name, persons leaving this gate in waggons, may arrive at Shamákhí in three days. Another gate leads towards Kipchák, Crimea and Circassia. In Dághistán, waggons with horses cannot travel, but the roads to Terek, Kazán and Desht Kipchák are all practicable for those vehicles. The third division of the fortress looks towards the sea; it is not so well inhabited as the other two, as the barracks for the garrison are the only buildings.",

Turn the corner from any of the main thoroughfares, and you will soon find yourself in a foul alley of crowded tenements, in the midst of a misery and squalor that wring the heart. You will wonder to see women laughing together and children playing on the damp pavements. It is thin laughter and half-hearted play; and yet, even here, there is a certain air of carelessness and good-humour. It may be that these miserable people do not realise their misery. Cleanliness is perhaps as painful to a person reared in dirt as dirt is to a person reared in cleanliness; slum dwellers, I suppose, do not notice the slum odour; a few decades of slum life must inevitably destroy or, at least, deaden those niceties of smell and taste and feeling which play so large a part in the lives of the well-to-do. And it is fortunate that this is so. But one threads one's way along these squalid streets, shuddering at thought of the vice and disease that must be bred there, and mourning, not so much for their unfortunate inhabitants, as for the blindness and inefficiency of the social order which permits them to exist.",

Drogheda itself is an up-and-down place, built on the side of a hill. I suppose the castle which was the nucleus of the town stood on top of the hill, and houses were gradually built from it down to the ford from which the town takes its name. Encircled with walls and dominated by its castle, it was no doubt picturesque enough, but it is singularly dingy and unattractive now, with slums almost as bad as Dublin's and evidences of biting poverty everywhere.",

Cormac McCarthy built it in the fifteenth century as a defence against the English, and it was held by the Irish until Cromwell's army besieged and captured it. Around the top of the tower is a series of machicolations, or openings between supporting corbels, through which the besieged, in the old days, could drop stones and[117] pour molten lead and red-hot ashes and such-like things down upon the assailants, and it is in the sill of one of these openings that the famous Blarney stone is fixed.",

I picked up somewhere, perhaps from the jargon of the guide, that this wishing-stone is the altar of Fin Barre's old chapel, but I haven't been able to verify this, and it may not be so; but the game is to put up a prayer to the Saint, and make your wish, and leave some token to show you are in earnest, and the wish will surely come true. Of course we made a wish and added some half-pennies to the collection on the altar. In turning over the trinkets already deposited there, we were amused to find two bright Lincoln cents.",

Muckross is far surpassed in interest by many other Irish ruins, but it is very beautiful, embowered as it is in magnificent trees and all but covered with glistening ivy. It is not very old, as Irish ruins go, for it dates only from the latter half of the fifteenth century, when it was founded for the Franciscans. The gem of the place is undoubtedly the cloister, with its arcade of graceful arches ranged around a court and lighting a finely-vaulted ambulatory. In the middle of the court is a giant yew, many centuries old, which spreads its branches from wall to wall. It is encircled with barbed wire, and I don't know whether this is to protect it from vandals, or to protect vandals from it—for the legend is that whoever plucks a spray of this tree dies within a twelvemonth.",

They are lighted on two sides by pointed arches arranged in groups of three, while on the side next the church the arches are grouped in pairs, and the fourth side is closed in by a lovely arcade, with double octagonal columns.

The shrine is hung with rosaries and crowded with figurines and pictures of the Virgin and of various saints, among which, I suppose, the learned in such matters might have picked out Saint Senan, who blessed this well and gave it its miraculous power. The trees which encircle the glade in which the well stands are also hung with offerings—sacred pictures, rosaries, small vessels of gilt, and the crutches of those who came lame and halting and went away cured. On either side of the entrance is a bench where one may sit while saying one's prayers, and in front of the shrine is a shallow basin, some two feet wide and a yard long, into which the water from the well trickles, and where one may sit and wash all infirmities away.",

There were a few people here and there cutting it, but a woman who had got into the compartment with us said that the continued wet weather had made the work very difficult and dangerous. All the people hereabouts, she added, lived by the turf cutting, at which they could earn, perhaps, ten-pence a day; but in bad seasons they were soon close to starvation. I remarked that, with such wages, they must be close to it all the time, and she[268] smiled sadly and said that that was true. Only, of course, in the bogs the children can work, as well as the men and women, and that helps. Indeed, we saw them many times—little boys and girls who should have been at school or running free, gaining health and strength for the hard years to come, tugging at the heavy, water-soaked blocks of peat, and laying them out in the sun to dry. It takes a month of sun to dry the peat; in wet weather it won't dry at all, and so isn't salable. Truly, the lives of the poor Irish hang on slender threads!",

All the women here in Galway were shawled, and beautiful shawls they were, of a delicate fawn-colour, and very soft and thick… A few had carts drawn by little grey donkeys; and the old woman in one of these was so typical that I wanted to get her picture.

Such hotels as those at Bundoran, Recess and Parknasilla—and there are many others like them, handsome buildings, splendidly equipped, set in the midst of beautiful surroundings—leave nothing to be desired. Nor are their rates excessive, considering the excellent service they offer, averaging a little over three dollars a day. In the smaller towns, the tariff is considerably less than this, though the service is almost as good. In places where the railroad does not itself own or manage a hotel, it usually sees to it that at least one under private management is kept up to a satisfactory standard. So no one wishing to explore Ireland need hesitate on account of the hotels. They will be found, with a few exceptions, surprisingly good.",

Two or three miles along country roads brought us to a gate; and here our driver, looking a little anxious, had a short conference with a woman who lived in a neat labourer's cottage near by; and finally he opened the gate and drove through.",

The visitor, expecting to see something magnificent and grandiose, is rather dashed at first to find how small it is; but after a few minutes' wandering over the queer columns of basalt, this feeling passes, and one begins to realise that it is really one of the wonders of the world. I am not going to describe it—every one has seen photographs of it, or if any one hasn't, he will find some opposite this page; and the photographs picture it much better than I can. There are some forty thousand of the pillars, the guide-book says; five-sided or six-sided for the most part, averaging, I should say, about fifteen inches in diameter, and so close together that a lead pencil is too thick to be thrust between them. The pillars are divided into regular, worm-like segments, some six or eight inches thick, and there are quite a lot of segments lying about, broken off from the columns. The whole bed is said by geologists to be nothing but a lava-flow, which broke up into these columnar shapes when it cooled and contracted.",

My own guess would be that these weather-beaten stones, like those others on the hill beside Lough Gill, antedate Ossian by at least two thousand years.

He was garbed as a clergyman, and he wore an Orange badge, and he was listened to with religious attention as he painted the iniquity of the Catholic church and the horrible dangers of Catholic domination. His references to King Billy and the Boyne and the walls of Derry were many and frequent, and he had all sorts of newspaper clippings in his pockets, from which he read freely, and though he was very hoarse and bathed in perspiration, he showed no sign of stopping. He intimated that, once Home Rule was established, the revival of the inquisition would be but a matter of a short time, that no Protestant would be allowed to own property, that no Protestant labourer could expect employment anywhere until he had abjured his religion, that their children would be taken away from them and reared in Catholic schools, and he called upon them to arm and stand firm, to offer their lives upon the altar of their country, and not retreat a step before the aggressions of the Scarlet Woman. I don't know how much of this farrago his audience believed, but their faces were intent and serious, and I fear they believed much more than was good for them.",

The disrobing is done in the outer chamber, which has a low stone bench running around three sides, and then the penitent enters a small inner chamber, descends some six or seven steps into the pool of water, and, I suppose, places himself below the stream which falls into the pool from the end of a pipe. As its name indicates, this well was supposed to have the power of washing away all disease, both physical and moral, and time was when it was very popular. The effect of the cold bath was so exhilarating, and the sudden sense of freedom from sin and disease so uplifting, that the penitents would sometimes rush forth to proclaim their blessed state without pausing to resume their garments. Naturally a lot of impious Orangemen would gather to see the fun; and finally both the secular authorities and the Catholic clergy set their faces against the practices, with the result that they gradually fell into disuse. Only single pilgrims, or small companies, at most, come now to bathe in the magic waters, and their behaviour is most circumspect. The cells, themselves, are well-nigh in ruins. A chapel to Saint Patrick, from whom these waters derive their efficacy, was begun during the day of their popularity, but was never finished, and now only a fragment of it remains.",

There, for a moment, his troops fell into disorder before the fierce attack of the Irish, and as he tried to rally them, a band of Irish horse rushed upon him, circled round him and left him dead upon the ground. Almost at the same moment, the white-haired Walker, who had exhorted the defenders of Derry never to surrender, was shot dead while urging on the men of Ulster. But though the Irish were able to hold their ground at first, and even to drive their assailants back into the river, a long flanking movement which William had set on foot earlier in the day, caught them unprepared, and they gave way, at last, before superior numbers and superior discipline.",

Monasterboice it is called—Mainister Buithe, the abbey of Boetius—and the way thither lies along a pleasant road, through a wooded valley—which, fertile as it is, is not without its traces of desolation, for we passed more than one vast empty mill, falling to decay. Then, on the slope of a hillside away ahead, we saw the round tower, or what is left of it, for the top of it is broken off, struck by lightning, perhaps. But the fragment that remains is 110 feet high! And seeing it thus, across the valley, with the low little church nestling at its base, one is inclined to think that Father Dempsey was not altogether wrong when he said he cared nothing about the theories of antiquarians concerning the round towers, for he knew what they were—the forefingers of the early church pointing us all to God.",

It is twenty-seven feet high, and is composed of three stones, the shaft, the cross with its binding circle, and the cap. The shaft, which is about two feet square and eighteen feet high, is divided into seven compartments on either face, and in each of them is an elaborately-sculptured representation of some Bible scene, usually with three figures. Although much worn, it is still possible easily to decipher some of them, for there is Eve accepting the apple from the serpent while Adam looks mildly on, and here they are fleeing from Paradise before the angel with the flaming sword, and next Cain is hitting Abel on the head with a club while a third unidentified person watches the scene without offering to interfere. At the crossing there is a splendid crucifixion, with the usual crowded heaven and hell to left and right; the binding circle is beautifully ornamented with an interlacing design; and the cap-stone represents one of those high-pitched cells or churches, such as we saw at Killaloe and Glendalough.",

Adjoining the ruins of the cathedral is the ancient and weather-worn “Cross of Cashel,” which was raised upon a rude pedestal, where the kings of Munster were formerly crowned. The ruins are more extensive than anywhere else in Ireland, for Cashel at one time was the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland and its greatest educational centre. Here the Pope’s legates resided and here Henry II., in 1172, received the homage of the Irish kings. But what gives the place its greatest sanctity is the fact that St. Patrick spent much time there and held there the first synod that ever assembled in Ireland, about the middle of the fifth century. That is supposed to have been the reason for the erection of so many sacred edifices and monasteries in early days. St. Declan lived there, too, and commemorated his conversion to Christianity by the erection of one of the churches. Donald O’Brien, King of Limerick, erected another, and his son Donough founded an abbey in 1182. Holy Cross, beautifully situated in a thick grove on the banks of the River Suir, was built in 1182 for the Cistercian order of monks. It derived its name because a piece of the true cross, set with precious stones and presented to a grandson of Brian Boru by Pope Pascal II., was kept there for centuries, and made the abbey the object of pilgrimages of the faithful from all parts of Ireland. This precious relic is now in the Ursuline convent at Cork.",

    "Description":"St. Patrick’s Cathedral is, perhaps, the most notable building in Ireland, and one of the oldest. During the religious wars and the clashes of the clans in the early history of Ireland it was the scene and the cause of much contention and violence. Its sacred walls were originally arranged as fortifications to defend it against the savage tribes and to protect the dignitaries of the church, who resided behind embattled gates for centuries. At one time St. Patrick’s was used as a barrack for soldiers, and the verger will show you an enormous baptismal font, from which he says the dragoons used to water their horses, and the interior was fitted up for courts of law. Henry VIII. confiscated the property and revenues because the members of its chapter refused to accept the new doctrines, and nearly all of them were banished from Ireland. He abolished a small university that was attached to the cathedral by the pope in 1320 for the education of priests. For five hundred years there was a continuous quarrel between St. Patrick’s and Christ Church Cathedral, which stands only two blocks away, because of rivalries over ecclesiastical privileges, powers, and revenues. Finally a compromise was reached, under which there has since been peace between the two great churches and relations similar to those of Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s in London. Christ Church is the headquarters of the episcopal see of Dublin, and St. Patrick’s is regarded as a national church. The chief reason why St. Patrick’s has such a hold upon the affections and reverence of the people is because it stands upon the site of a small wooden church erected by St. Patrick himself in the year 450 and within a few feet of a sacred spring or well at which he baptized thousands of pagans during his ministry. The exact site of the well was identified in 1901 by the discovery of an ancient Celtic cross buried in the earth a few feet from the tower of the cathedral. The cross is now exhibited in the north aisle. The floor of the church is only seven feet above the waters of a subterranean brook called the Poddle, and during the spring floods is often inundated, but in the minds of the founders the sanctity of the spot compensated for the insecure foundations.",

In 1172 Strongbow, the Welch Earl of Pembroke, leader of the Norman invasion, swept away the original building to make room for the present edifice, which was fifty years in building. The present nave, transepts, and crypt are those that Strongbow erected, having been thoroughly repaired and restored by Henry Roe, a wealthy distiller, at a cost of £220,000, between 1870 and 1878. In 1178 Strongbow died of a malignant ulcer of the foot, which his enemies attributed to the vengeance of the early Irish saints whose shrines he had violated, and he is buried within the church he built. His black marble tomb is on the south side, with a recumbent effigy in chain armor lying upon the sarcophagus. A smaller effigy in black marble, representing the upper half of a human form, lies beside him and is said to mark the tomb of Strongbow’s son, whom his father literally cut in half with his mighty sword for showing cowardice in battle. Sir Henry Sidney, who discussed the question at length in 1571, declares that there is no doubt that the remains of Strongbow were deposited here, but there is another tomb, with a similar effigy of one-half of his son lying beside it, in an ancient church at Waterford, where Strongbow dwelt in a castle and made his headquarters. The claims of the Waterford tomb are considered much stronger than those of Christ Church in Dublin, because that was where he died and where his wife and family lived after him.",

One of the viceroys of the sixteenth century, in a letter to the King of England describing its partial destruction by fire, wrote that he had “lost nothing but a few barrels of powder and the worst castle in the worst situation in Christendom”. The tower has not been used as a prison since 1798 and 1803, the rebellions of Emmet and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and the documents relating to their conspiracy are preserved there in the very cells where the men who were convicted by them lay awaiting trial and execution. The late Mr. Lecky, the historian, searched them thoroughly, and gave a surprising account of the character of the private papers that were seized with the effects of the patriots in those days. Love letters, poems, reflections on various subjects, rules of conduct, maxims of the sages, drafts of speeches, and proclamations in soaring language, and many attempts at literary work are mixed up with the reports of spies, informers, detectives, and officials,—some of them from comrades whose treachery was never suspected and which Mr. Lecky was not permitted to publish even at this late day. Some people think these malicious and incriminating documents should be destroyed lest they may sometime come to light and ruin the reputation of men who are highly esteemed by their fellow countrymen. But no one seems willing to give the instructions.",

    "Description":"Parnell’s grave in Prospect Cemetery is not neglected, although I have seen it stated repeatedly that such was the case. It occupies the most prominent place in the cemetery, on the western side of the memorial chapel, on a spot corresponding with that occupied by the towering monument of Daniel O’Connell on the eastern side. The grave is in the center of a large circle, surrounded by an iron fence, shaded by beautiful trees, and large foliage plants which were in full bloom. The turf is well kept, and here and there are memorial wreaths preserved under glass globes. In the center of the circle is a high mound, protected by a hedge of arbor vitæ, and ornamented by several rose bushes. The grave is in the center of the mound. At the head is an iron cross six feet high, and at the foot the name “Parnell” is worked out in large letters of box. One of the employees of the cemetery, who showed us around, said that it was the intention of Parnell’s friends to erect a monument to correspond with that of Daniel O’Connell on the other side of the chapel, but after a discussion of several years they had decided to place the memorial downtown at the site I have already mentioned, where it would always be before the eyes of the public. O’Connell’s body is buried in a crypt underneath the monument. His heart is in a casket in the chapel of the Irish College at Rome. \n\nSeveral other famous Irish patriots are buried in Prospect Cemetery, and I asked the guide where the body of Robert Emmet was laid. \n\n“That’s a great sacret,” he answered mysteriously, “an’ I wouldn’t tell it to yer honor avin if I knew; with all respict to yer honor. It woul’ be the same as me life is worth. The soul of Robert Emmet has gone to God. His bones is in the hands of the friends of Ireland, but will remain in their prisint sacred hiding place until Ireland is free.”",

It is like an island of verdure in the midst of an ocean of trade and commerce. On one side of the campus the outside world is kept at bay by a continuous line of dormitories and lecture-rooms which overlook a busy street from the windows of one wall and a peaceful lawn from the windows of the other. On the south side the barrier is a high iron picket fence hidden in a wonderful hedge of hawthorn and laburnum bushes. On the other side of that hedge are shops, and a street-car line that leads to the more attractive part of the city. There are only two entrances to the college green, one at the east end and the other at the west, and it is nearly a half mile walk from one to the other across the green and among the buildings. The main entrance and the main buildings face the Bank of Ireland and look upon Dame Street, which is the Wall Street of Dublin. There is a little green crescent to divide the entrance from the street, with bronze figures of Edmund Burke and Oliver Goldsmith, two of the most distinguished of the alumni.",

But I am assured by competent authority that the former and more humane version is the true one, and all agree that ever since those boisterous days every officer of the law who has been caught within the college grounds has been given an involuntary bath from “Old Mary.”",

    "Description":"Trinity College is one of the few great institutions of Europe which give full degrees to women on the same terms as to men. There is no distinction in rules or conditions or in any other respect. Women are admitted to all of the several schools—arts, science, engineering, law, and medicine—on an equal footing. There are now about one hundred in attendance. At first the university gave degrees to all women who could pass the regular examinations, and they came here in droves from Oxford, Cambridge, and other institutions where they had been hearing lectures but are not given degrees. All they had to do was to enter the examinations and fulfill the requirements. But two years ago this practice was stopped, and now no degrees are conferred upon young women who do not take the full course at Trinity. The fees are the same as for men—$50. The women students are mostly Irish, although a few English girls, who are not satisfied with the certificates given them at Cambridge and Oxford, come over here from Girton and other institutions and work for the full degrees of B.A., B.S., Ph.D., and even for diplomas in law and medicine. To accommodate them the university has recently purchased a fine old mansion in Palmerston Park, where fifty or sixty girls are now lodged under the care of a matron, subject to rules similar to those which govern the men students in the dormitories on University Green. Twenty-two degrees were granted to women in 1908, and about the same number in 1907, chiefly in the department of arts, which is the same as our academic courses, and most of the recipients are intending to be teachers in women’s schools and colleges.",

The cars are large and neatly kept, the conductors and motormen are very polite and love to give information to strangers, although they are paid only thirty and thirty-six shillings a week, which would certainly make men of their occupation very reticent in America. The roofs of the cars are arranged with comfortable seats, from which one can see everything within the range of human vision and gratify his curiosity about what is behind the high stone walls, green with lichen and ivy and overhung with lustrous boughs. There isn’t much satisfaction going about in an automobile in the immediate vicinity of Dublin, because the roadways are mere tunnels between walls eight feet high and overhung with foliage, which makes a perpetual twilight, a damp, cool atmosphere, a dustless ride, and a picturesqueness that an artist would admire. The owners of suburban homes have shut themselves in so successfully that nobody can see what they are doing or enjoy the wondrous beauties of their private parks. But the seats on the top of a tram car permit the public to penetrate their secrets, give an abundance of fresh air, gratify the love of motion that we all inherited from our savage ancestors, and enable us to look beyond the barriers into beautiful gardens and groves.",

Nearly every winter’s gale sent a ship or two to destruction, and the bodies of hundreds of poor seamen have been washed up where the children are now playing in the sand. Here and there the skeletons of dead vessels may yet be seen, but the North Bull is no longer dangerous. Modern devices protect navigation, and in the midst of the heather and the glowing yellow gorse golf links have been laid out and a clubhouse has been erected, surrounded by lilacs, laburnums, and hawthorns, now in the full glory of their bloom. It is only twenty minutes’ ride by street car from the center of Dublin, and the business men can come out here to spend the long summer evenings at their sport.",

They were erected early in the nineteenth century as defensive watch-towers, when the country was in dread of an invasion by Napoleon. The name was taken from similar towers in Corsica and Sardinia, where they were erected for protection against pirates in the time of Charles V. These towers are said to have originally had bells which were struck by hammers to alarm the people in case of danger; hence they were called “martello” towers, that being the Italian word for “hammer.”",

The tumuli are scattered over a large area, and, according to the theories of scientists who have explored them, contained the bodies of successive royal families of Ireland until the invasion of the Danes, when they were desecrated, looted, and nearly destroyed, just as the tombs of the kings of Egypt were stripped of their treasures by the Assyrians and other invaders.",

He was buried as he ordered—in the bank of his rath, standing erect, with his shield and weapons, with his face turned southward toward his foes, the Lagenians (Leinstermen). Next northward is Rath na Riogh (Rath of the Kings), probably the oldest structure at Tara, and the royal residence. It is oval, and 853 feet long from north to south. Within its inclosure are: Teach Cormaic (Cormac’s House), a rath with an outer ring, probably built by Cormac Mac Art. Its diameter is about one hundred and forty feet. Next to the northwest, and joined to Teach Cormaic by a common parapet, is the Forradh (“place of meeting”). Its greatest diameter being 296 feet and the diameter of the inner circle 88 feet. To the north of these, but still within the Rath na Riogh, is a mound called Dumha na n-Giall (Mound of the Hostages), on the flat summit of which was probably a house wherein dwelt the hostages often required by the ard-ri of minor kings, of whose fealty he might have doubts. No doubt the hostages of Niall of the Nine Hostages were kept here. To the west of this mound are the remains of another, the Dumha na Bo, or Mound of the Cow. Outside the inclosure of the Rath na Riogh, on the north, is Rath na Seanaidh, or Rath of the Synods, so called because of the synods held there by St. Patrick and his successors, though it is of much older date.",

For ten dollars a month a Belfast mechanic can get a neat and comfortable six-room dwelling, 20 feet front and 36 feet deep, with a garden 100 feet in depth. For five dollars and seven dollars and fifty cents a month he can get four or five roomed cottages that are equally comfortable. And the mechanics there take a great deal more interest in their homes than those in the rest of Ireland. If you will look through the windows as you pass through the streets you will see them draped with neat Nottingham lace curtains and linen shades. There are shelves of books and pictures, neat carpets and center-tables with a family Bible and photograph album and religious newspapers and periodicals. There are often books on theology,—more than anything else,—commentaries on the Bible and other denominational works, for the well-to-do Belfast mechanic is a Presbyterian and always prepared to defend the doctrines of that faith. The manufacturers, the merchants, and the middle classes generally are Presbyterians. The land owners, the professional men, the nobility, and the aristocracy are nearly all members of the Church of Ireland, while the common laborers are Roman Catholics.",

Having taken this oath, “The O’Neill” turned his face to the four corners of Ireland to signify that he was ready to meet all foes from whatever quarter they might come; kissed his sword and his spear to signify that he was ready to use them wherever necessary, and then descended from the stone and was hailed with wild acclamations as the chief of the O’Neills, while his knights knelt before him pledging their loyalty and devotion.",

A stream of lava, at the most twenty-six hundred feet wide and about fifteen miles long, was arrested by some means upon the extreme north coast of Ireland, and in cooling took the form of detached columns from six to thirty feet long and from eight to twenty-four inches in diameter. There are more than forty thousand of these columns in three parallel terraces, standing upright and presenting a smooth surface, but they are all separate and no two of them are of the same size or shape. There is said to be only one triangle, only one nonagon, and only one of diamond shape in all the forty thousand. Most of them are pentagons and hexagons and octagons.",

For there, within the shadow of gaunt and gloomy mountains, St. Kevin, “The Fair Born,” a prince of the House of Leinster, which produced five saints in a single generation, three brothers and two sisters, built seven tiny churches in a group. It is known as the Valley of the Seven Churches. Each of them has its own individuality. Each of them is dedicated to a different saint, and all have been the homes and the places of worship and the object of pilgrimage for holy men and devout Christians for thirteen hundred years. As Sir Walter Scott says, they are probably the oldest buildings now surviving in any country in which the Christian religion was taught, and naturally have a corresponding interest and sanctity to all who love their Lord.",

    "Description":"Curragmore, the seat of the famous Beresford family, is twelve miles in the opposite direction from Waterford, over hill and down dale, and through a most delightful country. It is an ancient place, for the Beresfords are a very old family, descended from Sir Robert la Poer, who landed with Prince John at Waterford in 1185 and was given a vast tract of land that had belonged to an Irish earl who refused to submit to the sovereignty of the Norman king. That was the fashion in those days when people were not so particular about the rights of others as at present. In this highly moral and righteous generation there’s a court sitting regularly to hear any complaints that a tenant may wish to make concerning the rent exacted for his farm or his cottage. A difference of opinion over a bed of turnips or a rabbit or “any other kind of bird” is argued one side and then the other by the lawyers, and many people are questioned to ascertain who is wrong and who is right. But at the date when the first Beresford arrived at Waterford from over the channel, his majesty the king decided the ownership of the territory in Ireland according to his whims. A frown could cost a man a farm and a smile could win him one. But life has not been all sunshine and taffy for the Beresfords. They have had their troubles like the rest of us. In 1310 the wife of John la Poer was burned as a witch—one of the grandmothers of that much beloved and hearty old sailor, admiral of the North Atlantic fleet of Great Britain, who visited us only a few years ago and made so many friends among the people of America.",

The Cork family is one of the most famous in the history of Ireland, although not one of the oldest. The first earl lived on Cork Hill, where the Castle at Dublin stands. He was a native of Hereford County, England, and was born in 1566. He studied law at the Middle Temple, London, and was called to the Bar, but, having no clients, he embarked for Ireland as an adventurer. After a while he obtained the favor and protection of Queen Elizabeth, which enabled him to amass considerable wealth and won him his title. His brother Michael, who went to Ireland with him, became Bishop of Waterford. Richard, a nephew, became Archbishop of Tuam, and his son, Michael, became Archbishop of Armagh.",

It was the site of a monastery established here by Fin-Barre, the patron saint of Cork, who came here about the year 700, built a chapel, and started a monastic school that became famous and attracted many students from the continent of Europe. The city grew up around that monastery and was first composed of students who lived in huts and cabins of their own construction while they carried on their studies. Then business men and farmers began to come in and Cork became a place of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the Danish sea-rovers who, after plundering it again and again, took a fancy to the place and settled down here themselves. St. Fin-Barre was buried in his own church and his dust was afterward taken out of the tomb and enshrined in a silver reliquary which was carried away by one of the O’Briens when he drove the McCarthys, who happened to be a power in 1089, out of his stronghold and looted the place.",

But very few people and only the most daring athletes have ever tried the experiment. The miraculous stone is the sill of a window, which projects from the main wall near the top of the tower. As it is eight or ten inches below the level of the floor and across an open space of about twenty or twenty-four inches, it is not only difficult, but dangerous to attempt to reach it. A slip would send you head first to the ground, one hundred and twenty feet below. The only way in which it can be done is for the person who tries to support himself over the edge of the wall by straps from the top, and, with his face upward, draw himself across until his lips can reach the stone. Almost everybody that visits Blarney Castle comes home with a tale of the time he had in kissing the Blarney stone, but no one has seen him doing so for years, and it can only be done by carrying tackle to the castle. Mrs. Hanna Ford, a gentle and considerate old lady, who has been custodian of the place for more than thirty-six years, told me that she had never known but half a dozen people to kiss the stone in all that time.",

It was thoroughly altered and restored about fifty years ago by the father of the present Duke of Ormonde, and has since been occupied the greater part of the year by the family. Fortunately, in the extensions and restorations, the original character of the structure has been preserved and its individuality has not been impaired. It forms three sides of a large quadrangle with three round towers, castellated in the style of the twelfth century. The dining-hall is one of the finest rooms in Europe and contains many pieces of gold plate, antique ivory, and china that have been in the family for centuries. The picture gallery is a splendid apartment, one hundred and twenty feet long and thirty feet wide, and contains more than one hundred and eighty pictures, including family portraits by Van Dyck, Holbein, Lely, Kellner, Reynolds, and others, and gems of Murillo, Correggio, Salvatore Rosa, Claude Lorrain, Tintoretto, and other great masters. In the drawing-room is a picture of the Virgin and Child, by Correggio, which was presented to the second Duke of Ormonde by the Dutch government in recognition of his services in the Low Countries during the reign of Queen Anne. The garden and the park are superb and the family are generous enough to permit the public to share in their enjoyment of them.",

As it was a holiday, all the people in the neighborhood were gathered at Cronin’s Inn when the two coachloads of passengers drove in from Macroom, and several of them accompanied us across to Gougane Island and told us the history of that sacred place. There was an old man with bog-oak walking sticks to sell, and boys with post cards, for there isn’t a spot in Ireland that hasn’t been photographed and transferred to a post card in hideous colors. Mr. Benjamin Shorten, a man of importance in the community, had hailed the coach when it passed his house, and was therefore not only an entertainer but a fellow-passenger of the strangers within his gate. And it was a strange story that he told us of the restoration of the ruins and the erection, by Mr. John R. Walsh of Chicago, in memory of his parents, of the little shrine on the site of St. Fin-Barre’s oratory which had been blessed by St. Patrick fourteen hundred years ago.",

The name signifies “a rough glen,” and that describes it exactly—a deep cleft in the mountains, a gash which some irresistible glacier made ages ago in the rugged rocks, about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, which terminates upon an exquisite little sheet of water, a branch of the Bay of Bantry, on the far southwestern coast of Ireland. The glen is filled with wonderful trees and wonderful flowers, which seem to bloom perennially. The surrounding mountains are of the wildest description, being naked moorlands covered with heather and gorse and huge gray bowlders and peaks which project into the air. Among them, it is said, there are no less than 365 little lakes, that number having suggested to the pious peasants, who attribute everything to apostolic interposition, that some holy saint prayed effectually for a separate one to supply water for each day of the year. The rocks reach far away to the westward and down into the cold blue of an uneasy ocean, which beats impetuously upon the outer walls, but the water is seldom disturbed by more than a ripple within the bay. For a combination of ocean, mountains, lakes, rocks, waterfalls, forests, and flowers I have never seen the like, and any one can easily understand why Glengariff is called the most beautiful spot in Ireland.",

There is a long extension, however, entirely in ruins, but it gives an idea of the enormous dimensions of the castle. It was surrounded by outworks of great strength, and you can see traces of the round watch towers at the angles. A stone staircase leads to the top of the tower, where a beautiful view of the country can be obtained. Few ruins in Ireland are so extensive and so well kept.",

    "NameOfTraveler":"William Eleroy Curtis",
    "YearOfTravel":1908,
    "Description":"Muckross Abbey ranks with Melrose Abbey in Scotland and Kenilworth Castle in England as among the most picturesque and interesting ruins in the world. The walls and the Gothic windows, the tower and several other distinctive features are well preserved, and the ivy drapery makes it an exquisite picture. The abbey stands within the park of two hundred and ninety acres that surrounds Muckross House and is the property of Lord Ardilaun, who has many beautiful places in different parts of Ireland, and cannot possibly enjoy them all; but none is so beautiful as Muckross House. He purchased the property of the Herbert family who inherited it from Florence MacCarthy More, who, in 1750 married Agnes, daughter of Edward Herbert of this county, and they had one son who was the last MacCarthy More in the direct line, and that famous family became extinct, for he died without issue in 1770, and the estate passed into the possession of his mother’s family, being the nearest relatives. The Honorable Arthur Herbert died in 1866, and a beautiful Celtic cross has been erected to his memory upon the highest hill in the neighborhood, overlooking the park that he prized so highly, and where he enjoyed so much pleasure. His widow and daughters lived there for thirty years until they expired, when the place was offered at auction and Lord Ardilaun bid it in for £63,000 for the estate, and paid £10,000 more for furniture, pictures, live stock, and other property, making it cost him altogether about £73,000. And now he offers it for sale—the whole thing, a house of thirty-two rooms, a park of two hundred and ninety acres, the ruins of Muckross Abbey, and history and legends galore—for £75,000. And perhaps he would take less from the proper person. In 1907 a syndicate was organized to purchase the place and turn it into a Monte Carlo. They proposed to make the handsome old mansion a gambling-house and erect a large hotel with all possible allurements near by; but when Lord Ardilaun learned of the scheme, he instructed his solicitors to insert in the deed a clause stipulating that it should be used for residential purposes only, and that made it worthless to the syndicate. So Muckross Abbey and its beautiful surroundings are still in the market.\n\nThe abbey dates back to the dawn of Christianity in Ireland, and its site was originally occupied in the fourth or fifth century by a monastery founded by St. Finian of Innisfallen and his monks. The present building, however, was erected by Donald MacCarthy More, Prince of Desmond, in 1330, and was finished by his son in 1340 for the Franciscan friars, who occupied it as a monastery and as a college. There was some kind of an institution on the same site between the monastery of St. Finian and the present one, for an ancient manuscript in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, gives an account of its destruction by fire in the eleventh century. The founder, Donald MacCarthy More, built the beautiful chapel as a burial place for himself and his posterity. It is also the burial place of the O’Donaghues of the Glens, and in the very center of the choir is a large square tomb in which was deposited the body of “The Great O’Donaghue,” the chieftain of the lakes, of whom Mr. Maurice R. Moriarity, the custodian, gives many interesting legends in his history of the ruins.\n\nThe O’Donaghues were connected by marriage with the MacCarthys, kings of Munster, and had their headquarters at Blarney Castle, near Cork. Twelve generations, so far as the inscriptions can be deciphered, of that proud family are lying there, and more than twenty generations of O’Donaghues. The last MacCarthy buried here was Florence, husband of Agnes Herbert, who lived in Muckross House until his death in 1770. The last O’Donaghue buried here was Donal, a direct descendant of The O’Donaghue of the Glens, who was a member of parliament and died in 1889. His son Jeffrey, “The O’Donaghue,” as the head of the family is always called, is a barrister living in Dublin, a gentleman of high reputation and much influence, although he has lost almost everything but his proud name and a lineage that is interwoven with the history of Ireland since human actions were recorded.",

The village of Adare has about six hundred people living in model cottages, which he and his father built for them, with vegetable and flower gardens and everything that an Irish peasant could ask for, including both Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. The former was once “The White Abbey,” founded by the Augustinians in 1230 and restored by the Earl of Dunraven in 1811 with great care. A portion of the monastery has been rebuilt for a national school and given to the Roman Catholics. The neighboring Franciscan Abbey, founded in 1315, was restored for use as the Protestant church in 1807. The Earl of Dunraven who lived in those days built a family mausoleum in connection with it, and turned the refectory of the monks into a schoolhouse for Protestant children. Although the earls of Dunraven have been members of the Church of Ireland, they have been generous and frequent benefactors of the Roman Catholic church, and there seem to have been successive generations of wise, thoughtful, and considerate men in that family.",

    "Description":"Galway is a foreign-looking little town, unlike any other we saw in Ireland, and much of the architecture is Dutch and Spanish, departing from the plain, ugly brick front without cornice or eaves which is so common elsewhere. The streets are irregular and run all sorts of ways; some very narrow and some very wide, and they vary in width at different places, with occasionally an odd-shaped space at the intersection. Everything looks old and shabby and out of repair. It is queer as well as significant to see buildings half in ruins in the principal streets and others with the glass broken out of the windows. There are some smart-looking shops, however, and neatly kept residences, but they are not frequent. Nor is the town well kept. The Common Council evidently lacks a sense of the æsthetic, because the streets are dirty, the park is scraggly, and the grass and trees are very much neglected. It is altogether the untidiest public park I saw in Ireland. Many of the people we met on the principal streets, particularly the women, are repulsive in their rags and dirty faces and unkempt hair and bare feet. We saw a few barefooted women in Tipperary and Limerick, but in Galway none of the working women wears shoes, although the men seem to be well shod. The women cover their heads with thick shawls that are often greasy and torn, and their faces show evidences of sorrow and privation, and perhaps other causes have left a mark.",

    "Description":"The scenery in Connemara reminds one very much of Norway except in the lack of the cleanliness for which the latter country is famous. The coast line is cut by deep jags and precipitous cliffs, like the fiords, and the mountains have the same stern and stony appearance, and the peat bogs that lie between them are similar to those in the Scandinavian countries, although the climate is much milder here. The fuchsia plant is commonly used for hedges, which all summer long is loaded with blossoms of purple and red. I had never seen a fuchsia hedge until I came to Ireland. The first was at Glengariff, on the southern coast, but since then we have found them everywhere along the Atlantic shore, in the western counties, hundreds of miles of them, inclosing pastures, meadows, and gardens and growing with wonderful luxuriance.",

In the Town there is neither Fort, nor Castle, nor scarce any people of warlike mindes.

An other street is situated on the hill side towards the River; because at the building thereof, there were many Pine trees, they named it Ocotelulco, which is to say, A pine apple plot. This street was beautifull, and most inhabited of all the Town, and there was the chiefest Market place, where all the buying and selling was used, and that place they called Tianquiztli; in that street was the dwelling house of Maxixca. Along the River side in the plaine standeth another street called Tizatlan, because there is much Lime and Chalke. In this street dwelled Xicotencatl, Captaine Generall of the whole Common-wealth. There is another street named by reason of the brackish water, Quiahuiztlan; but since the Spaniards came thither, all those buildings are almost altered, after a better fashion, and built with stone. In the plain by the riverside standeth the Town house, & other Offices, as in the City of Venice.",

And so is almost all Mexico new built with very faire and spatious houses with Gardens of recreation. Their buildings are with stone, and brick very strong, but not high, by reason of the many Earth-quakes, which would indanger their houses if they were above three stories high. The streets are very broad, in the narrowest of them three Coaches may goe, and in the broader six may goe in the breadth of them, which makes the City seeme a great deale bigger then it is. In my time it was thought to bee of betweene thirty and forty thousand Inhabitants Spaniards, who are so proud and rich, that half the City was judged to keepe Coaches, for it was a most credible report that in Mexico in my time there were above fifteen thousand Coaches. It is a by-word that at Mexico there are foure things faire, that is to say, the women, the apparell, the horses, and the streets. But to this I may adde the beauty of some of the Coaches of the gentry, which doe exceed in cost the best of the Court of Madrid and other parts of Christendome; for there they spare no Silver, nor Gold, nor pretious stones, nor Cloath of Gold, nor the best Silkes from China to enrich them.",

Some Hides, some Sugar, and some Tobacco are the chiefe commodities from thence. There are only two Townes of note in it, Oristana and Sevilla; here are built ships which have proved as well at sea, as those that are made in Spaine. This Island was once very populous, but now is almost destitute of Indians; for the Spaniards have slain in it more then 60,000; in so much that women as well here as on the Continent did kill their children before they had given them life, that the issues of their bodies might not serve so cruell a nation.",

It is reported for certaine that here in twenty daies herbes will ripen and roots also and be fit to be eaten, which is a strong argument of the exact temperature of the aire. It yeeldeth in nothing to Cuba, but excelleth it in three things especially; first in the finenesse of the gold, which is here more pure and unmixed; secondly, in the increase of the Sugar, one Sugar Cane here filling twenty and sometimes thirty measures; and thirdly, in the goodnesse of the soile for tillage, the corne here yeelding an hundred fold. This fertility is thought to be caused by four great rivers, which water and enrich all the four quarters of the Island; all four doe spring from one only mountaine, which standeth in the very midst and center of the Country, Juna running to the East, Artihinnacus to the West, Jacchus to the North, and Naibus to the South.",

From this Valley unto Guatemala, neither is there any ascent or descent but a plaine, broad and sandy way. The eye hath much to view, though compassed with Mountaines, in these two last leagues; for yet it may behold a Town of Indians which taketh up most of the way, and is counted as big as Chimaltenango, if not bigger, the houses lying scattered with a distance one from another, mingled with many fair buildings of Spaniards, who resort much thither from the City for their recreation. This Town is called Xocotenango, of a fruit named Xocotte, which is most plentifull there, and all about the Country; it is fresh and cooling, of a yellow colour when ripe, and of two sorts, some sweet, and others sowre, of the stones whereof the Indians make a fire; they lie so thick in the way, dropping from the trees for want of gathering and spending them all, that the Spaniards have begun to practise the buying of Hogs on purpose to let them runne about that high way, finding that they fat as speedily and as well with those plummes, as our Hogs doe in England with Akorns. All this way are also many faire gardens, which supply the Markets of Guatemala with herbs, roots, fruits, and flowers all the yeer. There are further in this Rode three water mills for the corn of the City, whereof the chief and the richest belongs to the Dominican Fryers of Guatemala, who keep there a Fryer constantly with three or foure Blackmores to doe and oversee the worke; What will not those Fryers doe to satisfie their covetous mindes? Even dusty Millars they will become to get wealth. The Frontispice of the Church of this Town is judged one of the best pieces of worke thereabouts; the high Altar within is also rich and stately, being all daubed with gold.",

With this my high conceiting thoughts stooped down to think of some second Chiapa; till having continued on a while by houses on my right hand and dunghils on my left, I came to a broader street having houses on each side, which seemed to promise a City at hand.",

Though the mountaines on each side doe strongly environ it, and especially on the East-side seem to hang over it, yet none of them are hinderers to Travellers, who over them have opened waies easie for man and beasts though heavily laden with wares of all sorts. The way from Mexico, if taken by the coast of Soconuzco, and Suchutepeques comes into the City North-west-ward, which is a wide, open and sandy rode; if it be taken by Chiapa, it lieth North-east, and entreth into the City between the mountaines, as before hath been noted. West-ward to the South-sea the way lieth open through the valley and a champaigne Countrey. But South or South-East, the entrance is over high and steepy hils, which is the common Rode from Comayagua, Nicaragua, and the Golfo dulce or sweet Gulfe, where the ships come yeerly and unlade all the Commodities which are brought from Spaine for Guatemala. This also is the way followed by them who take a journey meer East-ward from this City. But the chiefest mountaines, which straighten in this City and valley are two, called Vulcanes, the one being a Vulcan of water, and the other a Vulcan or mountain of fire, termed so by the Spaniards, though very improperly a Vulcan may be said to containe water, it taking its name from the heathenish God Vulcan, whose profession and imployment chiefly was in fire. These two famous mountaines stand almost the one over against the other, on each side of the valley; that of water hanging on the South-side almost perpendicularly over the City, the other of fire standing lower from it, more opposite to the old City. That of water is higher then the other, and yeelds a goodly prospect to the sight, being almost all the yeer green, and full of Indian Milpa's, which are plantations of Indian wheat; and in the small and petty Townes which lie some halfe way up it, some at the foot of it, there are Roses, Lillies, and other flowers all the yeer long in the gardens, besides Plantins, Apricockes, and many sorts of sweet and delicate fruits.",

These Indians are somewhat of more courage then those of other Townes, and in my time were like to rise up against the Spaniards for their unmercifull tyranny over them. The Churches are exceeding rich; in the Towne of Santiago, there was living in my time one Indian, who for onely vaine-glory had bestowed the worth of six thousand Duckates upon that Church, and yet afterwards this wretch was found to bee a Wizard and Idolater. These Indians get much mony by letting out great tuffes of feathers, which the Indians use in their dances upon the feasts of the Dedication of their towns.

I fried a young \"purp \", but the idea of eating dog meat rather set our stomaches against it. We are camped for the night at a clear slough of water, but I must give you a discription of these funny little animals, and their cities or communities They are a species of the \"mar- mot\", about as large as a guinea pig, of a brown or sandy color with heads like a terrier pup, which, I supose, has given them the name of dogs. They have a short stumpy tail, which is kept in a perpetual jerk when they are excited. They select for their city a level sandy plain, where they can easily dig their burrows. Their towns often rival in population the largest cities in Europe. There is frequently considerable regularity in ther streets. Their houses consist of little mounds, often two or three feet high, with a hole in the center, two or three feet deep vertically. Then extending to their apartments. As soon as they see such a monster as man, each one scampers off to his own house, and squats down in his hole, peeping out and barking lustily at the intruder, till he approaches too close, when they suddenly turn a sumer sault in to their burrows. If you are still, in a short time, they will look out again to reconnoiter. What is very strange, the owl and rattle snake are their constant companions, but we surmise for no good purpose, no doubt only to devour young pups.",

Prickly pears and sage brush are growing all along the road to-day. The Platte valley produces some very fine flowers, among which, are several varieties of the prickly pear, or cactus, which are now in bloom. The one, which is common in the states covers acres upon acres, and bears a rich yellow flower about the size of the palm of the hand. Some few are of a dark buff color, others some are tinted with various colors. The finest is a green prickly bulb, half imbeded in the sand bearing a bright red, many-leaved, rose-like flower, which is very handsome indeed. This cactus is known by the common name, as the \"melon thistle.\" In warm climates the prickly pear bears an excellent fruit, but I've heard no one say that the fruit comes to perfection so far north, yet I know of no reason to the contrary, unless, it is the shortness of the season. The roads being very bad we camped early, making only 15 miles. Those who went back to the bluffs have been winding their way over hills and ravines, sometimes in full view, sometimes out of sight. They can't come down to the river, and we hear that they are suffering for water.

One mistep of the horse would precipitate all into the deep water below. -- Afterwards we heard that a four mule team went over this bank the same day.\n\nJune 26 - We laid over to day having good pasture. Baked bread and pies in the fournoon. In the afternooon I mended our enameled cloth, which had got badly torn a few days ago in a gust of wind. The boys gathered some wild currants. I cooked them, but we did not relish them. This is the only kind of fruit we find on the way, except one day I saw some huckel berries growing on the mountain side. I often think of the fine fruit at home and the garden vegetables which I could relish more than any thing else Had a pleasant day. Could see hundreds of wagons passing on the South side of the river many were also passing on this side.",

It is a peculiar stream, ever shifting among numerous Islands, and in the dry part of the sea son it is almost lost in its deep sand bed. Although it bears no vesels upon its wide and rippling surface, yet it is of vast use to the emigrants and settlers on its banks. Rushing down from its snowy mountain sources, it bears its cooling waters through sandy plains and fertile meadows furnishing water and grass for the weary emigrants winding their way along its banks towards the far sundown of Uncle Sam's dominions. Good roads this morning but no water, travelled on till 2 o'clock p.m. to reach willow springs. Some of the teams were were about fagged out. Here we found about (500) hundred wagons camped, and had to wait our turn for hours to get our stock watered. There is no grass here, but some of the boys went back on the bluffs and found plenty so we concluded to lay over. We had a hard gust of wind which blew the sand into our faces till we were nearly suffocated.",

It is very difficult of ascent to the top of this gate owing to the numerous deep fissures among the craggy rocks Mr Dunlap and two others of our party made the difficult ascent and described the scene as grand and awful.

The scenery is beautiful, grand, often sublime. On either side, snow-capped mountains rear their tops to the clouds, their sides being robed in evergreens of pine and cedars while at their base nestles a rich herbage of vegetation, and varigated flowers, filling the air with rich odors, and here and there beautiful springs of pure crystal water, gush forth inviting the weary \"pilgrims\" to satisfy their thirst. [...] Passing out of this cañon, the road winds through heavy forests of pine and tamaracks, going down steep after steep, among rocks and loose stones till it again reaches another cañon, through, which, dashes another mountain stream. It was dark when we arrived in this cañon, and here, in a narrow place, with scarsely a mouthful of grass, we, with many others, are compelled to camp.",

The name it bears, and which has been given to it by modern travellers, has no connexion with its origin. Indeed, if we may credit Greek inscription, this monument is no older than the time of Dioclesian. It has a slight inclination to the South. The capital and base have never been finished. I did not measure its height; but it is loftier by two-thirds than the palm-trees around it. Cleopatra's Needles, of which one (as I before re- marked) has fallen, are obelisks of red granite, having three columns of hieroglyphics on each side. [...] The antique thimbles, which served for the base of these obelisks, still re- main; they rest on socles of three steps, are of Greco- Romanic construction, and confirm the architectural date of the received tradition, which affirms that their second erection occurred about forty years before CHRIST.",

Occasionally we were blind- ed by gusts of hot wind mixed with dust; and we knew, from the momentary oppression at our lungs, as it passed, that we were encountering the burning breath of the Desert. Here and there, on either hand, were circular villages, built on the rising ground, which, during the overflow of the Nile, be- come islands. The houses are of a conical form, built of brick and earth, and pierced with small, square holes, designed to admit just as much light as is strictly necessary, with just as little heat as possible. At intervals, too, we passed several isolated tombs of hermits and dervises, each shaded by a palm tree; that consecrated friend of the sepulchre, around the tops of which clouds of shrieking hawks flew at our approach.",

    "Description":"... at five hundred paces distance from Damanhour, were in the midst of the Desert, - so closely do the extremes of civilization and desolation approximate in this eastern world.\nWe trudged along for several hours through the sand ; and then, ascending a hill, we unexpectedly saw from its summit the Nile !\nDelightful landscapes now succeeded arid plains. In place of a palm-tree here and there lost in the burning horizon, we found forests of fruit-trees and fields of maize. Egypt is a valley, with a river in its centre and an immense garden on each side, shut in by the Desert. Birds of ruby and emerald, of brilliant song and plumage, unknown to us, fill the groves of mimosa and lilachs. Large droves of sheep and buffalo, led by lean, naked herdsmen, followed the course of the Nile which we were ascending. And, finally, by way of climax, two enormous wolves, attracted no doubt by the scent of the cattle, emerged from a wood fifty yards in front, and came to a halt as if to arrest our progress : our guides, however, succeeded in beating them off with stones. Night descended rapidly, and our way, intersected by ditches necessary to the irrigation of the country, became more and more toilsome. In many places our asses sunk to their knees in the swamps, and we were obliged to dismount; and occasionally we ford- ed actual torrents, wading to our armpits : this sort of bath, though much cooler, was also much less agreeable than that of Alexandria. At length the moon arose in full brilliancy, illumined our path, and gave a new character to this strange landscape. Despite our embarrassments, we could not be insensible to its beauties. On the summit of the hills which divide the valley from the Desert, the palm-trees gracefully waved their branches against the sky. Mosques were visible in every direction, their bases laved by the Nile, their walls surrounded by the shade and verdure of the sycamore. But we were constantly interrupted in our ecstacy, by a bog or a ditch ; so that, by the time Rosetta was in sight, we were drenched altogether, and our shoes, like Panurge's, took in water from our shirt-collars.",

A dome in the form of a heart reversed, surmounted by a crescent, crowns its white and festooned walls : from one of the angles, a madeneh of rare elegance elevates its galleries, while the opposite side seems to uphold an enormous mass of sand, resting like a hill on the declivity of the mountain. Tall palm- trees, also, shoot up their single stems through the thick and sombre foliage of the sycamores, crowning them as with an aigrette. The true believers say that the holy dervise, Abou-Mandour, sustains on his shoulders the mountains of sand which seem ready to swallow up the mosque, and choke the current of the Nile.",

    "Description":"Towards the close of the third day, after we had encountered divers head winds and shoals, three symmetrical mounds arose slowly under the glowing horizon; they were the Pyramids : and, at the same time, on our left, commenced the chain of Lybian mountains which enclose the Nile with their granite flanks. \nWe were unable to turn away from the gigantic monuments to which belonged so grand a record of antiquity, and so glorious a memento of modern days. There, too, was the battle-field of the modern Cambyses, where we, like Herodotus viewing the corses of the Persians and Egyptians, might have discovered the bones of our fathers. As the sun descended, his beams climbed the sides of the Pyramids, leaving their base in shade ; soon the summit alone sparkled, like a reddened point, and then a single ray, like a dis- tant beacon-light, seemed to float on the sharpened extremity. This soon detached itself and ascended towards the sky, as if to light up the stars, which, a moment after, began to twinkle in the firmament.",

At the foot of the Lybian range we began to perceive, through the sandy va- pours that darkened the air, the towers and domes of mosques surmounted with their crescents of bronze. By degrees this curtain, driven by the northern wind which wafted us along, was uplifted from Cairo, and we discovered the jagged outline of the tops of the buildings, their foundations being yet hidden by the swollen banks of the river.",

The lines traced on it indicate the years when the overflow of the water, reaching an unusual elevation, causes seasons of remarkable fertility. Here, every year, the sheiks of the mosques declare the height of the inundation, and apportion the measure of rejoicing which the people may indulge in ; or, with the resignation of Mussulmans, announce sterility and the fasting and famine to which the insufficient rising of the river condemns them. On our right stood the Pyramids of Gizeh, visible from the base to the summit; and there, too, was the hill formed by the Great Sphinx, which has guarded them for three thousand years, turning its granite face, mutilated by the soldiers of Cambyses, towards the tomb of the Pharaohs. On our left, was the bat-tlefield of Heliopolis, rendered famous by Kleber; its immense solitude extends farther than the eye can reach, and is enlivened by one sycamore which flourishes in the burning sand of the Desert.",

We sped through sumptuous bazaars, and streets crowded with Arabs and tents, until we arrived at the gigantic mosque of the Sultan Hassan. We next took the steep path leading, first, to Joseph's Divan, near which is a famous well, described to us by M. Taylor.

It is dug through a solid rock, in which also are steps for the descent: this stair-way is lighted partly by windows through the sides of the rock, and partly by torches.",

    "Description":"We had been seeing some sea-fowl as we went along ever since we started, and these became more numerous and diverse in kind the farther we ran down our longitude; so that we observed the greatest care in our navigation by day, and especially by night.\n\nBut all our watchfulness did not Isle of prevent us from discovering, at daybreak on the 28th of October, and already astern of us, a very flat palm-covered islet, which we must perforce have passed very close to in the course of the night. We made every endeavour to come up with it, but did not succeed until the third day ; when, having seen it to be inhabited, because of some big smokes they made, we got the boat into the water and she went away to reconnoitre the island with Lieut. Don Thomas Gayangos (and thenceforward every time the boat made a trip we went in her by turns) and her crew with their arms and other usual precautions. They examined the greater part of it, but found no spot where they could land, as the island is fringed all round with a reef of rocks on which the sea breaks heavily, making it impossible to get close in without involving great risk to the boat and crew. [...] \nFrom 26 to 20 Indians followed along the beach abreast of our boat, as well as on the reef and even in the water : it was observed that they were all pretty brown in colour, and there were two or three among them of more than ordinary stature. All were naked except for a whitey-grey breech-clout with which they had their parts covered.\n\nTheir hair was bristly and cut short at the neck, and in their hands they carried a long white club with a knob at one end; while, besides this long one, some of them held in the other hand another shorter one, about a vara in length, of some dark coloured or black wood. They set up a great yelling and made various signs by which we under- stood quite well that they meant defiance, and that they had no fear (though we could not be sure of this). They had neither women nor old men among them.\n\nThe entire island consists of a strip of low-lying land surrounding a lagoon within it which covers more surface than the whole of the land does; and on this we sawtwo canoes, one of them with two Indians and the other with six. The land is clothed all over with greenery, mostly scrub, and in parts there are some trees with medium-sized trunks and spreading branches. Coco-nut palms are the most numerous, and one may suppose that they get their breech-clouts from these, as well as the chief part of their sustenance; supplemented only by fish, of which there should be good store in the lagoon. The land is so low and flat that, when a short distance off, only the palms are to be seen, and these look as if growing out of the sea. By their antics, yells, and wonderment, one may believe that they have never seen any ship before.\n\nNo harbour was made out at any part of the island. It is situated, according to our observations and reckoning, in lat. 17° 20' S. and long. 240° 28' from the meridian of Tenerife! Our compass showed 8° 21' of Variation N.Ely.\n\nIt extends approximately three miles N. and S. and four E. and W.: in circumference ten miles. It is 1145 leagues distant from the Port of El Callao. The name of San Simón y Judas was given to it. Its examination being completed and a plan drawn of it as well as could be done from bearings, we delayed no longer, since this was not the island contemplated in our commission; and we pursued our course with the wind aft, moderate, from the E. and E.S.E.",

    "Description":"On the morning of the 31st of the same month of October we dis covered another island, which, from a distance, appeared like only a palm clump of the same kind as the former one ; and, as the wind was fresh and fair, it gave us an opportunity of coasting almost all round it in the Frigate, under short canvas and at a very little distance off, to reconnoitre for an anchorage while taking bearings as its extremities and outline came into view. It is low-lying land like the other ; and covered all over with brushwood, small trees and palms. It has a large lagoon within, occupying its centre, oval in outline like its circumference: we saw a canoe upon it towards the N.W. side.\n\nThe natives made big smokes, and about 12 or 14 Indians were seen, apparently of the same type as those of the other isle of San Simón, with their long pikes in their hands, breech-clouts, and one amongst them who looked like a woman leading a small child by the hand. They made signs to us as if desirous that we should land, which we did not attempt to do, because it was clearly impossible, owing to the beach being everywhere beset with reefs and rocks on which there was a heavy breaking sea, and over which the water enters and leaves the lagoon-from which I conclude there is no channel into it. There are but few inhabitants in all the island. Those we saw appeared to be peaceably disposed, for of the small number who followed along the beach after the Frigate all were not armed with spears or long pikes; and their having women and children with them, and making signs for us to go in to where they were, makes one think this.\n\nIt is situated, according to us, in lat. 17° 25' S. and long. 238° 40'. Our compass showed 8° 20' of Variation N.Ely as before. It extends six and a half miles S.E. and N.W., and three and a half N.E. and S.W., with a circumference of sixteen miles.

    "Description":"In the forenoon of the 9th of October we discovered another island of the same kind as the others, though larger.\nWe came near to it later and the boat went away to examine the E. and E.N.E. part of it, but found no place where a landing was practicable. She stayed but a few hours, however, as she was recalled from on board to bear a hand in towing the Frigate round the S.E. point of a bight in which she had got embayed very close in to the shore, through the wind having died down almost to a calm. We succeeded in working her clear of the land and the boat afterwards went in again to coast along and explore the S. and S.W. sides as far as to the N.W., taking soundings and noting down its points, bays, and lagoons, while we followed her at a moderate distance, N.W. But she neither found any appearance of bottom nor any place where the Frigate might let go an anchor : nor were they able to approach the beach anywhere without boat and crew becoming exposed to great risk (which our business did not warrant). Seeing then that the shore line from the N.W. round towards the N. was even more exposed and that the surf was breaking much more heavily along it, and that it was moreover begirt with reefs without a span's length of sandy beach anywhere', the boat was signalled to come away. \nSome 20 Indians of all ages and sexes were counted on the beach in the forenoon, whose build, clothing and weapons were the same as those of the other islands : there are some pretty blonde in hue, others of a tawny colour with frizzly hair, and others again with purely Indian features and the hair lank. The women were draped from the waist to their knees with the same material as the men's breech-clouts; and figured with blue on the shoulders, the entire buttocks, trunk, arms, and legs, in various patterns and stripes. In the afternoon also a great many collected when the boat approached, and as fast as she drew ahead some of them dropped behind, while fresh ones came out from their villages to replace them. Two of them were wearing strings of shells round their necks, and a woman was seen fishing in the lagoon with her net. \nThis island is larger than the others, but it, too, consists of very low-lying land surrounded by a reef which makes the islets that shut in the lagoon on its western side communicate with each other. These islets are also in- habited, and the whole island appears to teem with people, of whom the greater number are on the E. side. The soil is very fertile, for it is all covered with greenery and full of trees, especially coco-nut palms. Their dwellings are huts thatched with palm leaves, dotted about amidst the groves of palms. No doubt, by the signs they made, they are peaceably disposed ; although these too were almost all armed with very long spears or pikes, without knobs but having very sharp points\". \nThis island is situated in lat. 17° 55' S. and long. 236° 55'. Our compass showed 8° 15' of variation Nly. It extends twenty miles S.E. and N.W., and nine S.W. and N.E. Its circumference may be forty-nine miles; and it bears E. and W. 17° 30' Southerly with that of San Quintín, distant 32 leagues, and from El Callao 1214. It was allotted the name of Todos Santos'.",

    "Description":"In fact on the morning of the 16th of November at ten o'clock we sighted high land in the W.S.W. and made every endeavour to get near to it while daylight lasted.\n\nSeeing, as we approached, that it was no more than a high peak, the Comandante decided to reconnoitre it that same afternoon; and, being a moderate distance off by four o'clock, the boat went away to examine it, with the same precautions as usual (notwithstanding it was thought to be uninhabited).\n\nWhile the boat was still a good way off we saw number of people on the N.E. side clothed in white, and two canoes with two nude Indians in each. One of these came towards us and presently.. ... to suit her. She arrived in fact at a quarter after five, with her two Indians, who brought coco-nuts, which they at once handed up (the side) and gave in exchange for some trifle.\n\nWhat they asked for was in their language Curi, which we afterwards understood to be their name for nails or any other bits of iron? They would not come on board, nor accept anything after they had got through all their stock of coco-nuts for barter, in spite of our pressing invitations and coaxing; and as it was now late they took themselves off, making signs to us that they would return at sunrise.\n\nThe two Indians, though somewhat timorous, nevertheless showed themselves very affable, vivacious and intelligent.\n\nIn appearance they are well favoured, of good stature, fairly light in hue, being merely browned by the sun, and some- what tawny about their features and hair, which is crinkly and sticks up in an even mass all over. They had only breech-clouts on, the buttocks and hands being figured with a pigment between lead-colour and blue; and they were without weapons ofThe boat went on with her exploration round the island, and brought up with the grapnel at a spot on the W. side, between two rocks, where some of our people landed; but the warp having parted, and it being already late, they withdrew.\n\nIn the early morning as many as eight canoes with two or three Indians in each having managed to get quite close to the ship by daybreak, all bent on the same traffic as the previous afternoon's, many of them ventured on board, clambering up the side with great agility; and seeming very happy, taking notice of everything, but not showing much wonder.\n\nAt half-past eight our boat returned to the shore (and with her all the canoes) for the purpose of taking soundings and ascertaining whether it might be possible to anchor with the Frigate, both for our better satisfaction and to fill some water. One party of our men landed by means of the Indians' canoes at the same spot where they had done so the afternoon before, while the other party proceeded all round the island in the boat, taking soundings, and sketching a plan of it as they went. They found, however, no anchorage, whether for the Frigate or for the boat; nor, again, any place adapted for easily watering ship.\n\nBut they saw some twenty Indians or so of all ages and sexes, who comprised apparently all that were in the island.\n\nAccompanied and guided by a large number of these our men struck inland for something like a mile along a beaten path, and beyond that they had to clamber up by holding on to the roots of trees that stuck out from rifts in the rocks. They saw two clusters of huts, one of five and the other of seven huts, constructed of palm leaves, the poles of which they are framed being very neatly fitted together. Their greatest height is 3.5 varas, length from 8 to 10, and width 4.5 to 5.5: they are closed in only overhead. We found the jawbone of a corpse hanging up in one hut. Their furniture and chattels consist of little baskets and mats made of palm leaves and rushes; and in some cases a small wooden stool, very skilfully carved all out of one block and having its seat concave! In another there was a puppy of medium size, black and tan, with ears pointed and erect. In others they came across some pens containing pigs as large and as fat as those of Perú, and farther on a stone enclosure of 20 or 25 varas, decorated round about with posts carved as if with characters, which the Indians would not approach ; for, by the look of it, it is their burial place', which they hold in great respect.\n\nThey keep their fire below ground”, covered over with black porous stones' which lie strewn about the entire path and a good part of the hill. The whole of this latter is verdant and pleasing to the view ; but on the S.E and S.W. sides the soil is very fertile, and there the natives have their plantations of yams, plantains, coco-nut palms and other trees, some of which bear a sort of pine-cone of which they merely chew the segments at their insertion“, and others a fruit of the size and shape of an ordinary chirimoya, which, when cooked, is somewhat insipid but not ill tasted\". There are three different kinds of plantains, one of which is noteworthy for its size, for each fruit is nearly three inches in diameter and a cuartas in length: they eat these roasted. They make a sort of mash of these fruits with which they keep themselves sleek and lusty.\n\nBiscuits and salt pork are the only eatables of ours that they care for. In addition to the breech-clout, the men have some ponchos of finely made matting, and the women certain white drapery that they get from the bark of a tree after much beating out and working up. They clothe themselves with these from the waist downwards, and many of them over the whole figure.\n\nThe carpenter, also, went exploring ; but did not find anything particular in the way of timbers. They do all their wood-working with their stone hatchets and adzes, after the manner of our iron ones. They were shown howto plant and sow, and seeds of all the kinds we had on board were given to them.\n\nNeither minerals, nor aromatic plants, nor any spice tree, were observed. They have plenty of water of good quality ; but in a very inaccessible situation.\n\nNor was any image of importance noticed amongst them, nor did it appear that they render worship or adoration either to any animate thing or imaginary being.\n\nAs our people were coming away an old man presented a pig to the officer, without expecting anything in exchange ; and after bestowing ample rewards or gratuities on them, our men embarked, and with them three Indians all in very happy mood, while some canoes followed after the boat.\n\nOn seeing that she was being hoisted in and that we were going farther away, and already leaving them astern, two of the Indians departed : and we were only able to retain one, who came along quite unconcernedly. We heard him, and others too, several times mention “OTAHEYTE,” the name of the island the Instructions directed us to investigate, at the same time pointing to the W.\n\nIt is situated in lat. 17° 50' S. and long. 234° 55'. Our compass showed 70 of Variation N.Ely. It extends one mile and a third N. and S., E. and W. one; circumference four and a half miles. With the island of Todos Santos it bears E. and W. 3° Nly, distant 43 leagues; and from El Callao 1257.\n\nThe name of Cerro de San Cristóbal was given to this island, and the Indians call it Omayto.",

    "Description":"The name ISLA DE AMAT was given to this island.\nIt extends N.N.W. and S.S.E. nine leagues, W.N.W. and E.S.E. thirteen and a half leagues, circumference from forty to forty-five leagues; and lies sixteen leagues distant from the small island of San Cristobal, and 1274 from El Callao. \nIn figure it is like two islands united by a tongue of land two leagues in width which forms two lovely bays on its N.E. and S.E.' sides respectively; and the whole is encircled by a reef of rocks on which the sea breaks heavily, some three to as much as six cables distant from the main shore. Within this the sea is absolutely smooth. \nThere are only two short stretches off the N. and S. extremities [of the island] where there is no reef and the coast is exposed. For entering through the reef and reaching the land there are several breaks with channels of ample depth which expand inside into roadsteads or regular harbours as the plan shows; although it is to be noted that only the one where we lay at anchor in the Frigate (called after Santa Maria Magdalena) on the S.E. side, in the district of Sallalara’, is at present properly surveyed and has had any exact plan made of it. Time did not permit of so detailed an examination of the others; and one ought to be very careful in entering or leaving by them all, their mouths being skirted by low reefs which are not noticed save at very short range, besides which the wind is apt to die away in the entrance, and in such case any vessel may become endangered by the tides and currents. For these reasons it is necessary to try to pass in with a good steady breeze, in the morning and on the flood tide, for the ebb is much stronger and lasts (at any rate at the surface) a longer time. In the harbour of Santa Maria Magdalena during the full and change [of the moon] high water occurs at one o'clock in the afternoon, and the rise is only from one to one and a half fathoms.\nThere are rocky patches dotted about over the bottom, too, which cause much injury to one's cables. \nMost of the country-side is mountainous and rugged, and only on the N.W. and S.W. sides are there any level tracts and gently sloping valleys, besides the strip of land formed by the large bays on its N.E. and S.W. Never- theless it consists of black soil throughout, very fertile and well wooded,-strewn, indeed, with some loose stones, but covered everywhere with wild herbage, trees of various kinds and sizes, brushwood and thorns, which form, in places, dense and impenetrable thickets. Water is very plentiful, for permanent streams pour down most of the ravines and unite at the skirts of the hills to form middling- sized brooks and rivers. Most of the cultivation is to be found in the valleys and flats which extend from the foot of the mountains to the sea-beach, for it is here only that the natives reside ; and, in places, these are only two or three cables or even less, in width. Only the district of Payala is fairly broad. Palms with many coco-nuts are in the greatest abundance, for the entire island is fringed with these trees which, from a little distance off, afford a most beautiful prospect. There are five kinds of plantains: two of them especially noteworthy, the one for its size, and the other for its fine flavour; the latter being something like those they call “de la tierra\" at Lima. They have plenty of yams, of which they plant quantities, and these serve them, together with the other fruits I have mentioned in the description of Mount San Cristobal, for preparing certain puddings and mashes that they partially bake, and after- wards eat cold: and which are very nourishing for them. \nThere are also other fruits that they do not cultivate, some having the taste of a chestnut, others of a walnut, others of an apple; but they are not like those of Europe as to their form, nor as to the trees (they grow on), and are generally all of the poorest flavour to our palates. The few red sweet potatoes they also possess are exceedingly well-tasted. There is a root resembling ginger, and there are some white flowers like daisies, with a very nice scent: others in the likeness of poppies, which are also very pretty to look at, but the rest are commonplace”. \nThose who fare best are the Caciques and headmen, for they possess pigs of fair size, and also fowls; because (although we saw none) those who went round the island in the launch heard hens and cocks crow on two mornings, and they (the Chiefs] told us so too. Thus it is that the arii or Caciques are all stout, some of them to ungainliness, so that they have two Indians constantly kneading their legs and even then are scarcely able to stand upright.\nThe common people frequently suffer a dearth of food, and most of them support themselves on cockles, and some fish which they eat raw. The good and finer fish, of which there is great plenty in the sea, are (reserved) for the arii and principal persons. The men eat apart from the women, and they tuck such quantities into their mouths that they can scarcely chew: so that these all become regular little baker's ovens. \nThere are dogs of several breeds: some quite small, and others very large and hairy. Mice in plenty and very tame. Of special birds only blue parroquets with red bill and feet; but there are parrots, wood-pigeons and many other common birds. In the space of two leagues for which [our people) were able to penetrate into the interior in the neighbourhood of the harbour, though they did so with much labour on account of the rugged nature of the hillsides and denseness of the forest, a few good timbers were noted; some like a kind of lignum vitae, others resembling the yellow guaiacum, others seemingly adapted for yards and topmasts, others for knees and various requirements in shipbuilding, and yet others apparently serviceable, but of which no proper opinion could be formed because we were unacquainted with their lasting qualities and grain. \n[The description continues for several pages, focusing on housing, social relationships, etc.]",

Nearly one-fifth of the population of Argentina is to be found condensed in Buenos Aires, and much of it is urgently wanted elsewhere. It has survived all the vicissitudes of early colonization, and lived to complete in another half its destiny as the most magnificent and \"up to date\" of all the cities of South America. It is not a new growth, an upstart, liek many of the mushroom cities of North America. It possesses a history and the respectability which belongs of right to a town owning stirring traditions lasting through centuries. As a town, it belongs to a fine old worl aristocracy, and the same air which pervades Rio de Janeiro is perceptible in Buenos Aires, undestroyed, uncontaminated even, by the busy chaos of telephone wires, electric tram constructions, and other accessories of modern civilization which enclose it as an iron network.",

Since the dignified old Emperor Pedro stepped down from his throne to make way for the republic, Brazil has retrograded step by step. This is frankly admitted by Brazilians themselves, although they would not have the Empire back with magmficent possessions of as vet undeveloped natural resources, and a rich heritage of splendid possibilities, the material prosperity, the credit, and the respectability of Brazil has rather diminished than increased. Some of these national assests departed with the Empire, and Rio de Janeiro bears witness to a general downward tendency. It is written largely and plainly all over its dilapitated palaces and evil-smelling boulevards.",

It is here that one meets all the most effective dandies and the best-dressed women of the town, and the beauty of the gardens whitch stretch away on either side of the road, the attractions of the racecourse, and of certain sporting accessories, are quite sufficient to justify the popularity of this society migration.

It would be impossible to bombard Buenos Aires from any point attainable by ships of sufficient capacity to effect a bombardment. But military safety hardly compensates for commercial inconvenience.

There would be no inhabitants but for Buenos Aires.

    "Description":"Into the Tigre there flows a broad, flat stream called Las Palmas (or Lujan) which runs more or less parallel to the Parana, leaving a wide space of rich delta between them, intersected by a network or innumerable minor channels and waterways. Here on a Sunday morning a great part of Buenos Aires society loses itself. There are yacht clubs and rowing clubs, and every species of waterside amusement at the end of the 21 mile run by rail from the city, and there is enough space in the woods and gardens of the delta to absorb the whole pleasure-loving population of the city. Within memory of living people this delta was covered by forest and undergrowth thick enough to contain the lairs of the spotted jaguar of South America, which has left its name to the river but is no more to be found in its neighborhood. This is the fruit-growing suburb of the town. Miles upon miles of peach trees, mixed with figs and other fruit, extend in lines along the banks of the streams and canals, well-tended and cared for, and teh amount of fruit that is thrown upon the market from the delta country must be often in excess of the demand, even in this fruit-eating centre. The surface of the river is occasionally covered with the floating debris of the market gardens. A curious population has sprung up in the delta, which, I am told, is an admixture of Basque, Spaniard, and Italian, speaking Spanish and living an easy, indolent life in a sort of Eden which requires but little delving. They are a cheery, good-looking people, bright, intelligent, and contented, taking no great interest in politics, and indifferent to the revolutionary agitaions which occasionally rage around them. The richness of the delta alluvium extends to the districts which border it. It is on Las Palmas that the most productive grazing land in Buenos Aires providence is to be found. It is here that it is possible to put sixty sheep to an acre of grass (one hardly likes to write it down!), and these sixty sheep will live on that same acre all the year round. Cattle raising and agriculture are the backbones of the Argentine industry; the future of the country mostly depends on them.\n\n[Author describes in great detail horse breeding, cattle breeding, and sheep farming]",

Something of the Old World custom of separating women from men in large assemblies seems still to prevail in South America. At any rate I observed that the women love to place themselves in artistic rows (there is, by the way, one gallery reserved for women only), and admit of no ugly black and white blotches of male attire to interfere with the harmony of their perfect colour arrangements. It almost appears as if each individual unit dressed with a view to the effect of the whole company. And the total effect is brilliant, harmonious, and infinitely delicate and pleasing in colour expression. The opera itself is excellent ; no expense is spared by a music-loving people to obtain the best artists in the world. But that is a detail. No one goes to the Buenos Aires opera merely to listen to the music.",

Twenty kilometres (about 12 1/2 miles) from the junction are the famous falls of Iguazu, which may well be called phenomenal not only for the great beauty of their surroundings, but for their magnitude. More than a mile in width, and with a fall of over 200 feet, the whole volume of the river thunders down in a double cascade, sending up thick clouds of spray amidst the dense vegetation of a sub-tropical forest. The attraction of such scenery will tend rapidly to the development of the Misiones territory. Already the great landscape gardener of Buenos Aires, M. Thays, has taken the approaches to the falls in hand. A road of twelve or thirteen miles has been cut through the virgin forest, and every point of view which can give new interest to this magnificent spectacle will be made available. It will not be long before the great falls of South America will be as much of a world's show as those of the North.",

Mendoza is not the Mendoza of Spanish foundation in 1561. That lasted 300 years, and was completely destroyed by earthquake in 1861. [...] The present Mendoza is new, and looks it. the streets appear unfinished and teh houses stand in irregular and uneven rows on either side of them. the long avenue of the central boulevard has none of the grace of mature age, and the by-ways are but incomplete and muddy tracks, leading ti unknown surroundings.\n\nThe \"Bodegas,\" or wine making establishments of Mendoza, are its most attractive feature. A short drive from the station took us to one or two of the principal bodegas, which appear to carry on a large and successful trade in the peculiar wine of the country. It is a rough produce, and it never travels far. [...] There was one feature in the vineyards, noticeable by reason of its peculiarity. In the centre of each large field, an instrument which looked like a huge funnel or blunderbuss, was set up endways with its wide mouth pointing to the sky. It was, indeed, a blunderbuss of a special pattern, adapted for firing blank charges at thunderclouds in order to avert the plague of hail. Hail works destruction in vineyards all the world over; but it appears to be only in Italy and at Mendoza that this system of precipitating rain (and thus forestalling hail) is adopted.",

As the four batteries filed along teh boulevard under the chequered shadow of the trees they looked smart and servicable, well equipped, and well found both in men and mules. The men were distinctly above the average Argentine in physique, and some of teh mules were splendid animals. they form a new feature in the Argentine service, and it is certainly remarkable how soon both men and animals have been trained into all the outward appearance of smartness. [...] The uniform of light blue and white was perhaps a litte gay for artillery, but it was most effective for parade purposes. The batteries were brought into action just under the hills outside Mendoza. there was no hitch in the proceedings such as might have been expected with recruits so recently trained to the role of gunners, and the shooting appeared to be straight and effective. It would almost seem as if gunners, equally with cavalry, are \"born, not made,\" in Argentina.\n\nNaturally one expected to hear from the military officials of Argentina some expression of dissapointment at the prospect of peace after such elaborate and expensive preporations for war had been completed ; and undoubtedly the disappointment existed, but it was unexpressed. There was throughout the service a spirit of self-contained reserve in speaking of the chances of war which impressed me greatly.",

    "Description":"From Mendoza there starts a metre-gauge railway (the trans-Andine) up the barren valleys which lead to the Uspallata pass. Over the rising slopes which border the foothills, between stony unprofitable shelves of detritus and a scanty scrub of salt bush and acacia (growing scantier with the rise of the country), the rail runs easily. It might be a tract in the Baluch lowlands, or in the South African Karoo that we pass over-but for the frequent cactus. As we rise higher the hills grow to greatness, the landscape becomes variegated in colour, marbled on the hill-side with splashes of pink where the granite outcrop occurs, and powdery white about the lower slopes. But the prevailing tint is red. Bush there is little or none, but the feathery pampas grass fits itself into cracks and clefts, advertising its existence with waving plumes ; Farther up the line, where it twists in and out of frequent gullies, and breaks into ladder-rail to lift it over steeper grades, the walls of the valley approach each other. The river, smaller and swifter, and no longer meandering from side to side of the flat bottom of a slabsided canon, becomes white with the milky outflow of the glacier, and the stone-strewn sides of the slopes above it stand at steep angles. Now and then a perfect fan, smoothed and rounded, radiates out from a crack in the mountains, and down its steepest slope (just where the water-parting should be) is cut the water-course, defying all ordinary problems of gravitation and offering despair to the topographer. On the whole, I must confess to disappointment with my first view of the Andes. I did not expect Himalayan scenery, but I did expect something of the softer charm which radiates everlastingly from the pine-clad summits of the European Alps.",

    "Description":"In March, 1902, the Argentine section of the trans-Andine line ended abruptly at Puente del Inca (the Inca's bridge), where a remarkable natural bridge spans the river, and which is necessarily (in this country) attributed to the Incas. [...] However, the bridge of Puente del Inca has nothing really to do with the Incas. It is a curious natural feature that few people take the trouble to go and see. There is a very fairly comfortable hotel here, but the place and the hotel have already be left behind by the railway, which now reaches to Las Cuevas, just under the smooth slopes which entail the final struggle to the windy summit of the pass. When we passed that way in 1902, a night at the hotel and a drive in the very early hours of the morning was a necessity of the situation. The early drive was cold, and the party packed into the wagonette (drawn by four mules abreast) was too cold to be interested in the surroundings. The sky was clear and the stars intensely brilliant . At Las Cuevas (the present terminus) a change of animals was necessary, and the rest of the drive was but a weary drag up a dusty series of zigzags to the summit, nearly 12,000 feet above sea level.",

That drive to the roadside station of the narrow gaugue line was delightful: a broad, flat, white road, with easy grades; a gradual descent through flying clouds of dust to the sweet valley of the Aconcagua; a gentle change from the snow-patched crags of the summit and the stone-strewed slopes of the landslips below, to a tangle of wild green things admist which the tall fat spikes of a red-haired cactus stood up stiffly and strangely. It was all impressive, because it was so new, and so unlike anything that I had seen before. There was a certain familiarity about a rope bridge, across (or along) which an old woman was hauling herself slowly as she sat in the pendent wire loop. It was barbaric and hardly expected; and the galloping horses, driven in a circle over the wheat spread beneath them to be threshed, was another quaint glimpse of mediæval methods surviving in the modern world.",

Plantations have been formed near Talcahuano. There is, nevertheless, quite a large variety of useful timber from the southern forest already in the wood market, and so much demand has already been made on the best and most useful classes of wood, that large areas near the coast (notably, near Puerto Montt) have been denuded of much magnificent timber without any attempt at replacing it by plantation, or hope of preserving it by any system of conservancy. It was a reckless disregard of all ordinary laws of forestry which permitted the destruction of teh splendid growth of the alerce (Fitzroya Patagonica) near Puerto Montt. The ragged and weather-worn stumps which remain are witnesses to the splendid size of the trees and the ruthless nature of their destruction. there is not a good tree left. Fortunately, the best timber is at present found in positions more remote from the coast. Alerce and cypress are valuable whenever they are found, and it may happen that with the growth of the means of access to the upper valleys of teh Andes, where they chiefly exist at present, will come a growth of appreciation of the necessity for forest reservations, and forest nurseries.",

    "Description":"From the harbour of Talcahuano it is a very short run by rail to the lovely old town of Concepcion. The Intendente, or Governor, of the town rightly judged that the best he could offer to the stranger was a view of Concepcion from the hills above; so, after disposing of the inevitable reception (and the invariable but trying ordeal by champagne), we rode out of the quaint old plaza, across the poplar avenue (more stately and yet more blessed in the grace of its surroundings than the poplar avenue of Islamabad in Kashmir) , and up the steep red slopes of the hills to where we might watch the Bio-Bio interlacing the plains (threaded with poplar and now blue with the shimmer of autumn haze), and curling itself lazily to the lip of the sea. It was a typical view of Central Chile. The town of Concepcion (square built, with straight streets intersecting) packed its white houses round the central Plaza, and extended broken arms out into the yellow plains beyond. On one side of it were the sunlit hills, red and purple, with dark blotches of broken forest; and we stood on an outlying spur of them looking a cross the town and over the river to the shining sea. Below us was the Bio-Bio bridge, which is 1,889 metres in length and was opened in the year of grace 1889- so we were told. It wore an unsubstantial look because its girders rested on trestles with no apparent abutments, or protecting piers, to break the force of what is at times an unruly river. It looked just a narrow ribbon of communication between the town and the port of Talcahuano.\n\nIn every town of Chile the banks seem to occupy the best sites and to rise to the greatest architectural magnificence. So it is in Concepcion. But the shops are good, and the Club (with eighty English members) was emphatic in its welcome and impressive in its hopes of a speedy termination to a condistion of \"armed peace\" which handicapped trade and paralysed enterprise.",

The copper smelting is accessory to the coal mining, for no copper from Chilean territory is smelted here. The ores (carbonates and sulphates) are brought down from California in ships, and here undergo a succession of refining processes.\n\nBut memories of Lota are entwined with other visions than those of roaring furnaces and vast mountains of unutilised slag. There was a garden above Lota, on the cliffs overlooking the bay, which had been laid out by a Chilean lady, who, determined to redeem the black ugliness of the coal fields from which she derived her fortune by following the suggestions of artistic fancy, devoted the declining years of her life to landscape gardening. Nothing repays the artist in Chile like the development of its natural beauty in landscape form. For miles one might wander through the lovely leafy avenues of these gardens, turning occasionally into open spaces where fountains and statues broke the chequered lights, or where masses of flowers piled themselves in banks and beds against the velvet slopes of cultured turf and never lose sight altogether of the glitter of the western sea as it faded in hazy distance to meet the sunset.",

Cold and grey and misty was the usual condition of the atmosphere, but neither greyness nor mist could much affect the weird beauty of the endless procession of th e mountain scenery through which we glided and slid [...] Forest was everywhere about us, dense, shadowy, dark, and generally dripping. The long lines of the higher sierra were thick with it up to the point where the granite cliffs, polished and smoothed by ice-cap and glacier, gave foothold to vegetation only on their flat ledges. The little islets, that seemed to chase one another through the streaky grey sea, were rounded and packed with it [...] Sometimes there would come a break in the hills. Then one looked up the long blue vista of a valley, counting fold upon fold and spur upon spur, ever growing bluer and fainter in the distance, till a gleam of white shimmering light showed where the glacier lay at the end. Sometimes another inlet twisted out of the main course, running so deep into the heart of the hills that the head of it was lost to view. But the glacier made itself felt in the cold touch of the icy air which breathed from its mouth, and in the countless little white icebergs that tumbled along one after another round the curves of the inlet shore out into the open. Although it was difficult to imagine that anything so wet and so dripping as that prirmeval forest could ever make an effective blaze, still there were unmistakeable evidences of vast forest fires at intervals.",

    "Description":"Along the immediate rim of the sea there were usually rocks and kelp and mussels and sea creatures of many sorts. Here we could climb along with difficulty; but the leaving of the hard rocks of the shore, and the thrusting of one's body into the close set jungle of undergrowth was a process much more difficult. The countless masses of growing things, and the rotten substratum of things that had done growing, made a most insecure footing. The deep spongy moss let one in knee deep even when it covered a hard rocky surface. When it merely hid a slimy mass of interlaced and rotten tree trunks there was no known depth to which one might not descend. It would be easy enough for a man to disappear bodily (as in an Irish bog) whilst still wandering under the shade of those forest trees. The result is that no living four-footed creature is to be found in Patagonian jungles near the sea; and sport, as known to the British sportsman, does not exist [...] Thick as is t h forest growth there is nothing on the islands which can be called good timber. A few \"canoe\" Indians find there home in these still waters, punting from one small bay to another, and subsisting on the mussels (choros) and sea eggs which cluster thick on the rocky edges of the land. Immense \"middens,\" or mounds of cast-away shells, testify to a far more extensive Indian occupation than now exists, and all nautical wanderers through these by-ways of the sea speak of the rapid diminuation of the ancient coast tribes.\n\n[Author continues to describe his thoughts regarding the Native Americans he encountered]",

The entrance of the harbour is narrow, but becomes wider inside, and is enclosed on every side by high hills, where there are castles and fine houses, with many fruit gardens. On the left hand there is an eminence, surmounted by a great tower, said to have been built by Roldan, for which reason it is called the tower of Roldan. Opposite this hill there is another, where the city is built, and the gate and houses facing the harbour are so close to the water, that the walls are washed by it; and two towers stand out from the walls, rising from the sea about a sling's throw from each other.\n\nWhen it is necessary, a chain is stretched from one tower to the other, inside which the galleys and boats take refuge, in time of war. Between the town and the tower of Roldan there is a castle with high towers, battlements, and turrets, and a wall surrounds the whole, to guard the city. Towards the sea there are high rocks, so that no vessel could enter the port in time of war; and another wall runs along the sea face, within which there is a hill covered with vineyards and olive gardens, and between this hill and the wall there is a street, with many houses and shops. \n\nThe houses of Gaeta are very handsome to look at outside ; they are very high, with windows towards the sea.\n\nThe finest street is that which runs parallel to the sea, the others being steep, narrow, and bad for walking. In the chief street there is much merchandise, and the city has a considerable trade during the whole year.",

Not far from this church there is a fissure made in the rock, about ten brazas in depth, and fifty paces long, and so narrow that only one man could get into it at a time; and a hermit lives there named Santa Cruz. It is said that there is a record in the city, showing that this opening was made on the day on which Jesus Christ suffered his passion. Within the walls there are many beautiful houses and gardens, containing oranges, lemons, citrons, and vines, which are very pleasant to look upon.

The people of this island are Greeks, and were formerly subject to the empire of Constantinople; but they are now under a Genoese named Juan de Catalus, whose father married a daughter of the emperor. They tell a strange story concerning this Genoese: that about twenty years ago, when this lord, and his father and mother and two brothers were asleep in the castle, the earth shook and threw down the castle, killing them all except this Genoese lord, who escaped in the cradle in which he slept; and was found next day in a vineyard at the foot of the castle: and it was a great wonder that he thus escaped.

    "Description":"The island of Tenia, which is opposite the said city, used to be the port of the city, to which ships resorted. It was occupied by king Priam, who built a great castle on it, called Tenedos, for the defence of the shipping. This island used to be full of inhabitants, but it is now deserted. The boat was sent from the ship to procure water and wood, and some of the attendants of the embassy went to see the island, and found many vineyards and fruit trees, and game such as partridges and rabbits, and the ruins of a great castle.\n\nThe reason why this island of Tenia is uninhabited, is as follows:-About twenty-two years ago, the emperor of Constantinople promised to give the said island to the Genoese, for assisting him with some galleys in his war against the Turk; but he afterwards sold it to the Venetians, who settled on it, and fortified the town and castle. When the Genoese heard this, they declared that the island belonged to them, and that the emperor had promised it to them, and that he had no right to sell it to any one.\n\nThus there was discord between the Genoese and Venetians, and they both began to arm their feets, and committed great slaughter amongst each other, upon this island. Peace was made on condition that neither should have it; that the town and castle should be laid in ruins, and that the island should be left uninhabited. This is one of the causes why, at this day, there is enmity between the Genoese and Venetians.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon a vessel arrived in the port of Tenio, and they sent to ask where she came from. She was from Gallipoli, a place belonging to the Turk, but on Grecian land, and was bound for Chios, with a cargo of wheat; and she brought news that a great pestilence raged at Gallipoli.\n\nThe ambassadors were detained for thirteen days more, owing to the foul wind ; and from the said island of Tenio they could see a very high mountain called Monteston, which is in the land of Greece, and where there is a monastery of Greek monks, who lead very holy lives, and will not allow a woman, nor a dog, nor a cat, nor any tame thing which has young, to come near them : and they do not eat meat. This monastery is very rich, and they say that it is two days journey from the foot of the mountain to the summit, where the monastery stands; and, besides this one, there are fifty or sixty monasteries, where the monks all dress in black, and do not drink wine, nor eat meat, nor oil, nor fish, with blood ; and these things were related by some Greeks who were in the said ship, who had lived some time on that holy mountain.",

The most populous part is near the sea ; and the greatest traffic is from the city, by the gates which open on the sea, especially the gates leading to the city of Pera, on account of the ships which go there to unload ; and because those of both cities pass from the one to the other, with their merchandise.\n\nThis city of Constantinople contains many great churches and monasteries, but most of them are in ruins ; though it seems clear that, in former times, when the city was in its youth, it was the most renowned city in the world. They say that even now there are three thousand churches, large and small; and within the city there are fountains and wells of sweet water ; and in a part below the church which is dedicated to the Holy Apostle, there is a bridge reaching from one valley to another, over houses and gardens, by which water used to come, for the irrigation of those gardens.\n...\nThe city of Constantinople is near the sea, as you have been told, and two sides face the sea; and in front is the city of Pera. Between the two cities is the port, and Constantinople is thus like Seville, and Pera is like Triana, with the port and the ships between them; and the Greeks do no call it Constantinople as we do, but Escomboli.",

    "Description":"The first thing they went to see, was the church of St. John the Baptist, which they call St. John of the stone, and which is near the emperor's palace. On the top of the first doorway of this church there was a very rich figure of St. John, well designed in mosaic; and near this doorway there was a lofty capital, raised on four arches; and the roof and walls are covered with beautiful images and figures in mosaic. This mosaic work is made of very small stones, which are covered with fine gilt, and blue, white, green, or red enamel, according to the colour which is required to depict the figures, so that this work is very marvellous to behold. \nBeyond this place there is a great court, surrounded by houses, and containing many cypress trees: and opposite the door into the body of the church there is a beautiful fountain, under a canopy raised upon eight white marble pillars, and the pipe of the fountain is of white stone. The body of the church is very lofty, and near the entrance there are three small chapels, each containing an altar, and the door of the centre chapel is plated with silver ; and by the side of the door there are four marble columns inlaid with small jaspers, and silver crosses, and precious stones : and there are curtains of silk across these doors, placed there that the priest may not be seen when he goes in to say mass. The roof is very rich, and inlaid with mosaics. On the roof of the body of the church there is a figure of God the Father ; and the walls are inlaid in the same manner nearly to the ground; and the floor is enriched with jaspers. The chapel was surrounded by seats of carved wood, and between each chair there was a brazier with ashes, into which the people spit, that they may not spit on the ground; and there are many lamps of silver and of glass.\n\nThere are many relics in this church, of which the emperor keeps the key. On this day the ambassadors were shown the left arm of St. John the Baptist, from the shoulder to the hand. This arm was withered, so that the skin and bone alone remained, and the joints of the elbow and the hand were adorned with jewels set in gold. This church also contains many relics of Jesus Christ; but the ambassadors were not shown them on that day, because the emperor had gone out hunting, and had left the keys of the church with the empress, but he forgot to give her the keys of the place where these relics were kept. But on another day they were shown, as will presently be related. This church belongs to a monastery, and the monks have a very large hall, in the middle of which there is a table of white marble, thirty paces long, and there are many wooden seats round it; and there are three other small tables. Within the precincts of this monastery there are gardens, and vineyards, and other things which there is not space to describe.",

    "Description":"The same day they went to see another church called Peribelico, dedicated to St. Mary. At the entrance to this church there is a great court, containing many cypresses, walnut trees, elms, and other trees. The outer walls of the church are covered with images and other figures, in gold, blue, and other colours. On the left hand side of the entrance to the church there are many figures, and amongst them an image of St. Mary, with one of the emperor and another of the empress on each side. At the feet of the image of St. Mary there are representations of thirty castles and cities, with the names of Grecian cities written under them. They say that these cities and castles formerly belonged to this church, having been given by an emperor called Romanus, who lies interred here. At the feet of the image there were certain documents written in steel, and sealed with seals of wax and lead, which described the privileges enjoyed by this church over those cities and castles.\n\nThere are five altars in the body of the church; which is very large and lofty, supported on pillars of various coloured marble, and the walls and floor are inlaid with jasper; and the ceiling is inlaid with very rich mosaics. On the left hand side, at the end of the church, there is a handsome stone monument, where the body of the emperor Romanus is interred: they said that this monument was formerly covered with gold and precious stones, but that when the Latins captured this city, ninety years ago, they plundered this tomb.\n\nIn this church there is another great stone tomb, in which another emperor is interred, and this church also contains the other arm of the blessed St. John the Baptist, which was shown to the ambassadors. This was the right arm, and it was fresh and healthy ; and, though they say that the whole body of the blessed St. John was destroyed, except one finger of the right arm, with which he pointed when he said “ Ecce Agnus Dei,” yet certainly the whole of this arm was fresh and in good preservation, but it wanted the thumb. [There is another paragraph about the thumb involving a dragon.]\nIn this same church they were shown a small cross, a palmo in length, ornamented with gold, with a small crucifix and it was placed in a recess which was covered with gold, so that it could be taken out and replaced at pleasure. They say that it is made of the wood of the true cross, on which our Lord Jesus Christ was placed, and its colour is black.\n\nOutside the church there is a cloister, where there are many beautiful representations of history, among which is the root of Jesse, showing the lineage whence came the blessed Virgin Mary. It was figured in mosaic; and was so wonderful, so rich, and so well drawn, that it surpassed all the other works. There are many monks belonging to the church, who showed the above things to the ambassadors and also took them into a very large and lofty refectory, in the midst of which there was a table of white marble, very well made, being thirty-five palmos long, and the floor was of marble flags. At the end of this refectory there were two small tables of white marble, and the ceiling was covered with mosaic work; and on the walls pictures were represented in mosaic work, from the salutation of the blessed Virgin Mary by St. Gabriel, to the birth of Jesus Christ our God, together with his journeys with his disciples, and all his blessed life, until he was crucified. In this refectory there were many flag stones, made to place meat and other food upon ; and in the monastery there were many cells, where the monks live ; and gardens, and water, and vineyards, so that this monastery is like a large town.",

    "Description":"On another day the ambassadors went to see a plain called the Hippodrome, where they joust. It is surrounded by white marble pillars, so large that three men can only just span round them, and their height is two lances. They are thirty-seven in number, fixed in very large white marble bases ; and above, they were connected by arches going from one to the other, so that a man can walk all round, on the top of them; and there are battlements, breast high, of white marble, and these are made for ladies, and maidens, and noble women, when they view the jousts and tournaments which are celebrated here. In front of these seats, there is a row of pillars, on which is a high seat, raised on four marble pillars, surrounded by other seats, and at each corner there are four images of white marble, the size of a man; and the emperor is accustomed to sit here, when he views the tournaments. Near these pillars, there are two blocks of white marble, one on the top of the other, of great size, each one being the height of a lance, or more; and on the top of these blocks there are four square blocks of copper.\n\nOn the top of these blocks there is an immense stone, sharp at the end, at least six lances in height. It is not fixed in any way; so that it was marvellous to think how so great a mass of stone, yet so sharp and fine, could have been placed there. It is so high that it may be seen above the city, from the sea. This column has been placed there in memory of some great event; and on the base there is an inscription, announcing who it was who caused this stone to be placed there, and for what reason ; but as the writing was in Greek, and it was getting late, the ambassadors could not wait to have it read to them. But they say that it was raised to commemorate some great deed. Beyond it the range of columns continues, though they are not so high as the first, and the deeds of the knights are painted on them ; and between these columns there are three copper figures of serpents. They are twisted like a rope, and they have three heads, with open mouths. It is said that these figures of serpents were put here, on account of an enchantment which was effected. The city used to be infested by many serpents, and other evil animals, which killed and poisoned men ; but an emperor performed an enchantment over these figures, and serpents have never done any harm to the people of the city, since that time.\n\nThe plain is very large, and is surrounded by steps, one rising above the other to a considerable height; and these steps are made for the people of the city; and below them there are great houses, with doors opening on the plain, where the knights who are going to joust are accustomed to arm and disarm.",

    "Description":"On the same day the ambassadors went to see the church which is called St. Sophia, which is the largest, most honoured, and most privileged of all the churches in the city; and it has canons who do duty as if it was a cathedral, and a patriarch, whom the Greeks call Marpollit.\n\nIn a court, in front of the church, there are nine very large white marble pillars, the largest I ever beheld, and it is said that a great palace used to stand on the top of them, where the patriarch and his clergy held their meetings. In this same court, in front of the church, a wonderfully high stone column stands, on the top of which there is a horse made of copper, of the size of four large horses put together; and on its back there is the figure of an armed knight, also of copper, with a great plume on his head, resembling the tail of a peacock. The horse has chains of iron round its body, secured to the column, to prevent it from falling, or being moved by the wind. This horse is very well made, and one fore and one hind leg is raised, as if it was in the act of prancing. The knight, The knight, on its back, has his right arm raised, with the hand open, while the reins are held with the left This column, horse, and knight, are so large and high, that it is wonderful to see them. This marvellous horse is said to have been placed here by the Emperor Justinian, who erected the column, and performed great and notable deeds against the Turks, in his time.\n\nAt the entrance to this church, under an arch, there is a small but very rich and beautiful chapel, raised upon four marble columns; and opposite this chapel is the door of the church. It is very large and high, and covered with brass, and in front of it there is a small court, containing some high terraces ; beyond which there is another door covered with brass, like the first. Within this door there is a broad and lofty nave, with a ceiling of wood, and on the left hand there are very large and well built cloisters, adorned with slabs of marble and jasper of various colours. The body of are of the church contains five lofty doors, all covered with brass, and the centre one is the largest. The body of the church is the loftiest, most rich, and most beautiful that can be seen in the whole world. It is surrounded by three large and broad naves, which are joined to it, so that mass may be heard in all parts of the church. The arches of the naves green jasper, and unite the roofs of the nave with that of the body of the church; but the summit of the latter rises much higher than that of the naves. It is dome shaped, and very high, so that a man must have good eyes who looks up from beneath ; and the church is one hundred and five paces long, by ninety-three broad; and the dome is supported by four pillars, very large and thick, covered with flags of many coloured jaspers ; and from pillar to pillar there are arches of green jasper, which are very high and sustain the dome. In the arches there are four very large slabs, two on the right hand and two on the left, which are coloured with a substance made from a powder, artificially, and called porphyry. The dome is covered with very rich mosaic work, and, over the high altar, the image of God the Father, very large, is wrought in mosaics of many colours; but it is so high up, that it only looks about the size of a man, or a little larger, though really it is so large that it measures three palmos between the eyes; but to him who looks at it, it does not appear to be more nor less than a man, and that is owing to the very great height it is placed above the ground.\n\nOn the floor, in the centre of the part under the dome, there is a pulpit placed on four columns of jasper ; and the sides of it are covered with flags of jasper ; and this pulpit is surmounted by a capital, raised on eight very large jasper columns; and here they preach, and also say the gospel on feast days. The walls and floor of the church are lined with flags of jasper, worked all over with ornaments, very beautiful to behold. The part between the arches, which supports the dome, was of very handsome white stone, on which many appropriate figures were inlaid, and above that there was very rich mosaic. The arched roofs of the naves surrounded the dome, except where the high altar stood, all which was worth seeing. The said arched roofs were ninety paces broad, and four hundred and ten paces round, and they were beautifully inlaid with mosaics. In the wall, on the left hand side, there is a very large white slab, on which, among many other figures, was drawn, very naturally, without any human artifice of sculpture or painting, the most sacred and blessed Virgin Mary, with our Lord Jesus Christ in her most holy arms, with his most glorious forerunner, St. John the Baptist, on one side. These images, as I said before, are not drawn, or painted with any colour, or inlaid ; but the stone itself gave birth to this picture, with its veins, which may be clearly seen ; and they say that when this stone was cut, to be placed in this most holy place, the workmen saw these most wonderful and fortunate images on it, and, as this church was the most important one in the city, that stone was deposited in it. The said images appear as if they were in the clouds of heaven, and as if there was a thin veil before them.\n\nThis appeared most wonderful, as a thing which God himself had shown; and at the foot of these images there is an altar, and a small chapel, in which they say mass ; and in this church was shown the holy body of a patriarch, which was entire, both in bone and flesh.\n\nThe ambassadors were also shown the gridiron on which the blessed St. Lawrence was roasted; and in the church of St. Sophia there are vaults and cisterns, and subterranean chambers, which are strange things, wonderful to see. Near the church there are many fallen edifices, and doors leading to the church, closed and ruined. In the church there is a very large cistern under ground, capable of floating ten galleys. All these works, and many others in this church, were shown, so that they can neither be related nor written briefly; and so great is the edifice, and the wonderful works in the church are so numerous, that they take a long time to see. The roofs are all covered with lead. This church is privileged, and any person, either Greek or of any other nation, who commits a crime, either of robbery or murder, and takes refuge here, may not be taken hence.",

They then mounted on horseback, and went to see a church called “ Santa Maria de la Cherne,” which is within the city, and opposite to a ruined castle, which used to be a lodging, used by the emperors. The said castle was destroyed by an emperor, because he found his son in it, in a manner that will be related to you presently.\n\nThis church of Santa Maria de la Cherne\" used to be a chapel of the emperor's, and the interior consists of three naves, the centre one being the largest and most lofty, and the other two being lower. They are vaulted, and the arches connect them together. These naves are adorned in the following manner. They are raised on great pillars of green jasper, and their bases are of white marble, inlaid with many figures. The ceilings and the walls, half way up, are covered with flags of jasper of many colours, with many figures and beautiful works artificially wrought upon them.\n\nThe ceiling of the centre nave is very rich, made of timber in squares and beams, all gilded with very fine gold; and though parts of the church were much out of repair, this gilded ceiling looked as fresh and as beautiful as if it was just finished. In the centre nave there was a rich altar and a pulpit, also very rich; and all the furniture of the church is very rich and costly, and the roof was all covered with lead.",

Between the city walls and the sea, opposite Pera, there are many houses, in which many things are sold, and warehouses.\n\nPera is a small city, but well peopled and surrounded with a wall, and it contains good and handsome houses. It is inhabited by Genoese, and is a lordship of Genoa. It is peopled by Genoese and Greeks, and is so close to the sea, that between the wall and the water there is not sufficient breadth for a carrack to pass. The wall runs along the shore, and then ascends a hill, on the top of which there is a great tower, whence the city is watched. This hill, however, is not so high as another outside the town, which rises above it; and on that eminence the Turk encamped when he besieged Pera and Constantinople, and here they fought, and hurled missiles from engines. The Turk twice assaulted the city, and blockaded it by sea and land for six months, with four hundred thousand men on land, and sixty galleons and ships by sea; but they were unable to enter, nor even to occupy a suburb, so that it seems that the Turks are not good combatants, as they could not enter.",

This sea is also dangerous because, when ships approach the strait, it is very difficult to know it, and if they miss it, they go on shore and are lost, as has happened many times; also, if when the strait is made out, and the vessel is near it, any of the gales arise, she is in danger of being driven on shore, and in this manner a vessel was lately lost which was coming from Caffa.\"",

    "Description":"The ambassadors desired to depart at once, but they could not. They, however, hired horses to carry them as far as the land of Arsinga, and men to guard them. On Friday they set out, accompanied by ten men on horseback, and at the hour of mass they came to a castle, on the top of a high rock, which also belonged to Cabasica, where they found men in the road, who took a toll from them. At noon they came to a valley where they were told that there was a castle belonging to the Turks of a lineage called Chapenies, who were at war with Cabasica, and that in the valley there was a guard, which waited for passengers. At the hour of vespers they came to a town of Arsinga, called Alangogaza, and Cabasica's ten men took leave of them. On this day the road was very mountainous ; and in this town there was a Turkish cavalier, who held the place for the lord of Arsinga.",

Many people came out from the city, to receive and to see the ambassadors, and they were conducted to the lodgings which had been prepared for them. That night the lord of the city sent them boiled and dressed meat, and much fruit, and bread, and wine.\n\n[Subsequent pages contain some interesting points about food and drink as well as hospitality.]\n\nThis city of Arsinga was built on a plain, near a river which is called Euphrates,' which is one of the rivers that come from Paradise. This plain is entirely surrounded by very high mountains, and on the top of the highest of these mountains there is much snow. There are many towns, and fruit gardens in the plain, which is covered with corn fields and vineyards, and very beautiful gardens. The city was not very large, and the walls and towers which surrounded it, were built of stone. It was built by the Armenians, and the sign of the cross is cut on many parts of the walls. The houses all have terraces, and the people walk along the terraces, as if they were streets. The city is very populous, and contains many fine streets, and it is very rich, and has much trade, and many beautiful mosques and temples. It is inhabited by many christians, Greeks, and Armenians. They say that when Timour Beg took and destroyed a Turkish city called Sabastria,' that the Turk came against this city of Arsinga, and entered it; but when Timour Beg conquered the Turk, he came to this city, and took it for himself.",

    "Description":"On Thursday, the 29th of May, at noon, they reached a great city called Calmarin, and from it, distant about six leagues, they saw the great mountain on which the ark of Noah rested, after the flood. This city was in a plain, and on one side flowed the great river called Corras; and on the other there was a very deep and rocky valley, as broad as the flight of an arrow; and it encircled the city, until it united with the river. The valley and river made the city very strong, so that it could only be attacked where the river commenced; but at this place there was a very strong castle, with great towers, and it had two gates, one in front of the other. This city of Calmarin was the first city that was built in the world, after the flood, and it was built by the lineage of Noah. The people of the city said that, eight years ago, Tetani, Emperor of Tartary, besieged the city, and that they fought day and night for two days, and on the third there was a parley. They gave up the city, on condition that neither he, nor his people should enter it, but that the citizens should pay to him a certain annual tribute ; with which the emperor was satisfied, but he demanded that half the people of the city should be given up to him, to go with him to the land of Jugania,' where he was going to make war on the king Sorso. When the citizens had given up these men, the emperor attacked the city, entered it by force, pillaged and burnt it, making breaches in the walls, and killing many people.\n\nThe greater part of the inhabitants were Armenians ; but the land of Armenia has been taken from the Christians by the Moors, as I will relate to you, presently. In this city there are very great edifices; and throughout all this country, they gave the ambassadors and their people lodging, and food, and horses; for all the land belonged to Timour Beg.",

It was very high, and the summit was covered with snow, and it was without woods; but there was much herbage upon it, and many streams. Near the road there were many edifices, and foundations of houses, of stone; and great quantities of rye was growing, as if it had been sown by man, but it was useless, and did not come to grain ; and there was also plenty of water cresses. At the foot of this mountain they came to the ruins of a town long since deserted, which was a league in length ; and the people of the country said that it was the first town that was built in the world, after the flood, and that it was founded by Noah and his sons.\n\nAfter leaving these ruins, they came to a great plain, in which there were many streams of water, and trees, and rose gardens, and fountains.\n\nThe mountain had a very sharp peak, which was covered with snow, and they say that the snow never leaves this peak all the year round, either in winter or summer, and this is on account of its great height.\n\nOn this day the ambassadors took their siesta by a beautiful fountain, near a stone arch; and while they were there, the clouds moved away, and the peak of the mountain appeared, but they suddenly returned, and the people said that it was very seldom visible.\n\nNext to this mountain, there was another, which also had a sharp peak, but not so high as the first, and between these two peaks there is one like a saddle, and they were all very high, and their summits were all covered with snow.",

    "Description":"On Wednesday, the 11th of June, at the hour of vespers, they arrived at the great city of Tabreez. This city is in a plain, between two high ranges of hills. It is not walled, and the hills on the left hand are very near the city, and are very hot, and the water which descends from them is not wholesome ; but those on the right hand are more distant, and they are very cold and capped with snow, and the water which descends from them is very good. These streams come down to the city, and flow through it in various directions.\n\nIn the range of hills, opposite the city, there are two high rocks, which used to be united, but every year they move further from each other. In the range on the left hand side there is a high hill, which, they say, was once bought by the Genoese, from a ruler whose name was Sultan Veis, for the purpose of building a castle upon it. They add, that after it was sold, he changed his mind, and, when the Genoese wished to build the castle, he sent for them, and told them that it was not the custom for merchants to build castles in his country. He said that they might take their merchandize away, and that if they wanted to build a castle, they might move the hill out of his territory. When they answered him, he ordered their heads to be cut off.\n\nFrom the range of hills on the right hand, a great river descends towards the city, and is divided into many channels, which flow through the streets. In this city there are many well ordered streets and lanes, where they sell many things.\n\nIn some of the streets there are very large buildings, with many doors, within which are shops, and there are officers who keep order. From these buildings there are gateways leading to certain streets, where they sell many things, such as cloth, silk, cotton, tafeta, and other stuffs ; and this city has a great trade.\n\nIn one place, in these buildings, there are certain men who sell many kinds of scents and pigments for women; and the women come themselves to buy them, and they paint and anoint themselves. These women go about, covered all over with a white sheet, with a net, made of black horse hair, before their eyes, and thus they are concealed, so that no one can recognize them, In this city there are many grand edifices, especially mosques, which are ornamented very skilfully with mosaics, and blue and gold work, made in Greece. They say that these great works were made by very rich men, who were jealous of each other, and each strove to erect the most wonderful work, and in this way they spent their wealth.\n\nAmongst these edifices there was a great house, which was surrounded by a wall, very beautiful and rich, in which there are twenty thousand chambers and apartments; and they say that this house was built by a ruler of Persia, named Sultan Veis; with the treasure that was paid him, as tribute, by the Sultan of Babylon. He called this house Tolbatgana, which means “ the house of fortune.” This house is well built.\n\nThe city of Tabreez is very large and rich, owing to the quantity of merchandize that passes through it, every day.\n\n[Folllowing paragraphs discuss food, religion, politics, government.]",

    "Description":"On Thursday, the 22nd of June, at noon, they arrived at the great city of Sultanieh, where they found Miran Meerza, the eldest son of Timour Beg. On Friday morning they went to see the said Miran Meerza; and as it is the custom for every one who goes to see him, to give him some thing, the ambassadors brought some cloth, and other things.\n\nThey found him in a palace, where there was a large fruit garden, full of armed men ; and he received them very well, and invited them into a tent where he was sitting, asking them after the health of the lord our king.\n\nAfter they had talked for a long time, they were asked to eat, and the ambassadors ate according to their custom, and, when they wished to go away, they were given some robes to dress in.\n\nThis city of Sultanieh is in a plain, and has no wall; but it has a castle with strong walls, and handsome towers, and all the towers and walls were ornamented with patterns, and each tower had a small catapult on the top.\n\nThis city is very populous, but it is not so large as Tabreez, though it possesses more trade. Every year, especially in the months of June, July, and August, very large caravans of camels arrive, with great quantities of merchandize. They mean the same as we do by the word caravan, namely, a drove of beasts. This city has a great traffic, and yields a large revenue to the lord. Every year many merchants come here from India, with spices, such as cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, manna, mace, and other precious articles, which do not go to Alexandria. Also all the silk which is made in Gheelan comes here, and Gheelan is a province near the sea of Bakou, where much silk is made every year. This silk of Gheelan is sent to Damascas, and Syria, and Turkey, and many other countries. Also there arrives all the silk which is made in the province of Xamahi, and merchants come here for silk, even Venetians and Genoese.\n\nThis land is so hot that when any foreign merchant is struck by the sun, he is killed; and they say that when the sun strikes any one, it presently penetrates to his heart and kills him, burning his back very much; and those who escape, almost always remain quite yellow, and never return to their proper colour.\n\nThere also arrive in this city many silken cloths, cottons, tafetas, and other stuffs from a land called Shiraz, which is near India, and from Yesen, and Serpi ; and from Khorassan there come cotton threads, and cotton cloths, woven in many colours. This land of Khorassan is a great territory, which extends from Tartary to India. Many precious stones also arrive in this city of Sultanieh. From Cathay vessels come within sixty days journey of this city, having navigated the western sea, which is the sea which bounds this land; and they come to a river, which is ten days journey from the city of Ormuz. The ships and boats which navigate this sea have no iron; but their timbers are joined with cords and wooden pegs; for if they were united with iron, they would soon be torn to pieces by the loadstones, of which there are many in that sea. These ships bring many pearls, and some of them bring rubies, (which are very fine in Cathay), and much spice; and from Ormuz these things are sent to all parts of the world.\n\nMost of the pearls are found in that sea of China, and they bring them to the city of Ormuz, to be pierced and cut; and the Moorish and Christian merchants say that they know of no place where the pearls can be pierced, except this city of Ormuz. The city of Sultanieh is sixty days journey from the city of Ormuz. They also say that these pearls are formed in large shells, which they call jacares; and those who come from Cathay, and from Ormuz, say that the pearl is formed in the shells, which are large, and as white as paper. Theybring them to this city of Sultanieh, and to Tabreez, where they make girdles and rings of them.\n\nAll the merchants who come from the land of the Christians, from Caffa, and Trebizond, and the merchants of Turkey and Syria, come every year, at this time, to the city of Sultanieh, to make their purchases. This city is situated in a plain, and many channels of water pass through it, and in it there are many well ordered streets, where the people sell their merchandize. In this city there are several large inns, where the merchants lodge. The city is surrounded by very extensive and populous plains ; and on the right hand there are some mountains, and beyond them is a land called Koordistan. These mountains are very wild, and there is snow upon them all the year round. On the left hand there is another range of hills, which are very hot, and behind them is the province of Gheelan, and the sea of Bakou,' which is surrounded by land, and is not connected with any other sea whatever; and it is six days journey from Sultanieh to the sea of Bakou. Diamonds are found, on some islands in the sea of Bakou. Snow never falls in the land of Gheelan, because it is so hot; and it produces many citrons, lemons, and oranges.\n\nThe city of Sultanieh has a great traffic, and yields a large yearly revenue to the lord ; and this city, with Tabreez, and the empire of Persia, was formerly governed by Miran Meerza, the eldest son of Timour Beg, but he has been deprived, for the following reasons :-Miran Meerza, being the ruler of this land, had many knights with him, and a large army, which his father had given him. Being in the city of Tabreez, he ordered a great number of houses, mosques, and fine buildings to be destroyed, and many were pulled down.\n\nHe then went to Sultanieh, ordered the same to be done there, took his father's treasure out of the castle, and divided it amongst his followers. Outside the city, a little apart, there was a very fine edifice, built by a great knight, who lies interred within it. Miran Meerza ordered this also to be destroyed, and the body of the great knight to be cast out. [...]\n\n[Following paragraphs provide dialog between Miran Meerza and his father, etc.]",

After they had eaten, the knight said to them that, on another day, they should go and visit a great Meerza, who was son-in-law to the lord.\n\nWhen the ambassadors were going to depart, he gave Ruy Gonzalez a dress, and a hat, and said that he was to accept them as a token of the friendship which Timour Beg felt for his king.\n\nThis city of Teheran was very large, but it had no walls, and it was a very delightful place, well supplied with everything ; but it was an unhealthy place, according to the natives, and fevers were very prevalent. The territory in which it stands is called Rei, which is a great and extensive lordship, possessed by the son-in-law of the lord.\n\nThe road from Sultanieh to Teheran is very level, and the country is populous, and very hot.",

    "Description":"On Thursday they reached a great city, on the banks of a river, and two deserted castles.\n\nOn Thursday, the 17th of July, in the night, they arrived at a city which is called Damghan, situated in a plain, and surrounded by an earthen wall, with a castle at one end.\n\nThis city is in the province of Media. On this day it was so hot, with a hot fierce wind, that it was quite wonderful.\n\nThe wind was so hot, that it seemed as if it came out of hell; and on this day a ger falcon escaped, and flew away.\n\nOutside the city there were two towers, so high that a man could scarcely throw a stone to the top of them. They were made of mud, and the heads of men; and there were air ;two other towers, fallen to the ground. These towers, which are made of heads, are built of the heads of a race of people called “white Tartars,” natives of a country between Turkey and Syria. When Timour Beg departed from Sebastria, and marched towards Damascus, he encountered these people, fought, and conquered them ; taking many prisoners, and sending them to settle at Damghan, which was thinly populated. When they arrived there, they collected together, and lived in the plains, as was their custom. When they were all assembled, they desired to return to their native land, and they set out on their journey, robbing every one they met. When they were near this city, the army of the lord met them, defeated them, and killed them without mercy. The lord then ordered that these four towers should be built, of their heads, plastered together with mud. He also ordered that every white Tartar, wherever he might be found, should be put to death, and so it was done. The army, when they received this order, killed every white Tartar they could find; so that along the roads, in one place ten, in another twenty dead bodies might be seen, and they say that sixty thousand of these Tartars were killed. The people of the city say, that they often see lights burning on the top of these towers in the night.",

    "Description":"On Tuesday, the 22nd of July, they slept at a city called Jagaro, and the day was very hot. This city was in a plain, at the foot of a mountain, without trees, and large pipes lead water from the mountain to the city. In the middle of the city there is a castle, on the top of a mound of earth, and the city had no wall of any kind. In the previous winter there was much snow, and when the summer came, it melted ; and so much water came down the pipes that it ruined the castle, and several houses. The road was very level, and there was not a single stone to be found on it; and the country was very hot, and with little water.\n\nWhen they arrived, they were given plenty of meat, and fresh horses; and they set out again with the knight whom the great lord had sent, who provided them with food, and with all that they required ; and gave them fresh horses every day, that they might travel faster. The lord had horses waiting at the end of each day's journey, at some places one hundred, and at others two hundred ; and thus the posts were arranged, on the road, as far as Samarcand. Those whom the lord sent in any direction, or who were sent to him, went on these horses as fast as they could, day and night.\n\n[...]\n\nNot only was this road thus supplied with post horses, but there were messengers on all the roads ; so that news could come from every province, in a few days. The lord is better pleased with him who travels a day and night for fifty leagues, and kills two horses, than with him who does the distance in three days.\n\nThe great lord, considering that the leagues were very long, in his empire of Samarcand, divided each league into two, and placed small pillars on the roads, to mark each league; ordering all his Zagatays to march twelve, or at least ten of these leagues, in each day's journey. They call these leagues moles, because these turrets, which he caused to be built at the end of each league, and these leagues, the length of which he regulated, are in a country which is called Mogolia. The ambassadors travelled in the country, and saw the pillars, and each of the leagues was equal to two leagues of Castille.\n\nIn truth it would scarcely be believed, unless it was actually seen, the distances which these fellows travel, each day and night; for they ride as far as their horses can carry them; and they do not only travel the distance which the lord has ordered, but they sometimes go over fifteen and twenty leagues in a day and night, without any consideration for the toil of their horses. When their horses are knocked up, they kill and sell them, if they are in an inhabited country; but we found many dead horses on the road, which had been killed by hard riding.",

These tents were not made in the usual way, but they were long, and of black cloth, and a people called Alabares lived in them.\n\nThese people do not possess anything but their tents, and they do not live in cities or villages, but in the open plains, as well in winter as in summer. They have large flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, besides twenty thousand camels.\n\nThey wander, with their flocks and herds, over all the territory of the lord, and pay a yearly tribute of three thousand camels and fifteen thousand sheep to him, for the right of grazing in his territory. When the ambassadors came to their tents, the chief came out, and led them to a tent, and gave them much milk and cream, according to their custom.\n\nThey departed from the tents, and set out for the city, but Gomez de Salazar was left behind in a village, very ill, as he could not travel any longer.\n\nThe city of Nishapore is in a plain, and is surrounded by gardens, and very handsome houses. The ambassadors were conducted to very fine lodgings, and the chiefs of the city came to them with meat, and fruit, amongst which were very large and good melons, and also they sent them much wine.\n\nAfter they had eaten, they were presented with a robe, as it was the order of the lord that, whenever they arrived at a city, they should either be presented with a robe or a horse.\n\nThis city is very large, and well supplied with all things.\n\nIt is the chief city of Media, and here they find torquoises, and, though they are met with in other places, those of Nishapore are the best that are known. They are found in the earth, near a river which descends from a mountain, above the city. The neighbourhood is very populous, and fertile. Here the land of Media ends, and the land of Khorassan commences, which is a great empire.",

These Zagatays have received the privilege from the lord, to go where they like for pasture for their flocks and herds, as well in summer as in winter; and they serve the lord in his wars, whenever they are called for. They do not leave their women, children, and flocks behind, when they go to the wars, but take them all with them. The women, who have little children, when they travel, carry them in small cradles before them, on their horses, and they tie these cradles with broad bands, which they fasten round their waists; and thus they travel with their children, and ride as light as if they were without them. The poor people carry their children and tents on camels, and this way of travelling is very wearisome for the children, as the camels go very uneasily. Not only do these people, whom we met on the road, live in these plains ; but there are a vast number of others, for, when we found some in any place, many others also appeared, in one part or another, and so we travelled amongst them. Near towns, and places where there was water and pasture, we met many of them, and they were so burnt by the sun, that they looked as if they had come out of hell. This country was very flat, and very hot, and most of the troops who followed the lord, travelled by night; and the ambassadors remained amongst these tents of the Zagatays, until night. \n\nOn Friday, at noon, they came to a village, where they dined, and took their siesta. In the night they arrived at a great city, the name of which I have forgotten, but it was very large, and formerly it was walled, but now the wall is fallen, and most of the city is deserted, and in this city there were great edifices and mosques.

It is a league in width, and flows through a very flat country, with great and wonderful force, and it is very muddy. It is lowest in winter, because the waters are frozen in the mountains, and the snow does not melt: but in the month of April it begins to increase, and goes on increasing continually for four months ; and this is because the summer melts the ice and snow.\n\nLast summer they said that it had swollen much more than usual; for it increased so much that the water reached a village, near the banks, and destroyed many houses, doing great damage.\n\nThis river descends from the mountains, flows through the plains of the territory of Samarcand, and the land of Tartary, and falls into the sea of Bakou. It separates the government of Samarcard from that of Khorassan.",

    "Description":"On the Thursday that the ambassadors reached this great river, they crossed to the other side, and, in the afternoon, they arrived at a great city called Termit, which once belonged to India the Less, but is now in the territory of Samarcand, having been conquered by Timour Beg, and from this place the empire of Samarcand begins. The territory of this empire of Samarcand is called Mongolia, and the language of the people is Mongol, so that those on the other side of the river do not know it, as they speak Persian: and the handwriting which they use on the Samarcand side of the river, is not understood by those on the other side.\n\nThe lord has certain scribes who read and write this Mongol writing. The land of Samarcand is very populous, and very rich and fertile.\n\n[Paragraph about customs.]\n\nThis city of Termit, which the ambassadors had reached, was very large and populous, and it was without any wall.\n\nThe city was surrounded by many gardens and streams of water. I cannot tell you more of this city, because we were very tired when we reached our lodging, except that we passed through populous streets and squares, where they sold many things. The ambassadors were received with much honour, and supplied with all that they required, and were presented with a silken robe. In this city a messenger arrived from the lord, who came to the ambassadors, and said that the lord saluted them, and desired to know how they had borne the journey, and how they had been treated, and whether they would soon arrive. When this messenger departed, they gave him a robe, and they also gave a Florentine robe to the knight who had been sent first, and who had come with them, the ambassador from the Sultan of Babylon doing the same. They also gave a horse to the second knight, whom the lord had sent; for such is the custom of all who come to the lord, to give something, and thus respect the custom of giving and taking presents. Their greatness is considered according to the number of presents they give, in honour of the lord, and such is the measure of the praise they receive.",

These palaces had a long entrance, and a very high gateway. On each side there were arches of brick, covered with glazed tiles, and many patterns in various colours. These arches formed small recesses, without doors, and the ground was paved with glazed tiles. They are made for the attendants to sit in, when the lord is here.\n\nIn front of the first entrance there was another gateway, leading to a great court yard paved with white stones, and surrounded by doorways of very rich workmanship. In the centre of the court there was a great pool of water, and this court was three hundred paces wide. The court led to the body of the building, by a very broad and lofty doorway, ornamented with gold and blue patterns on glazed tiles, richly and beautifully worked. On the top of this doorway there was the figure of a lion and a sun, [...]\n\nThis doorway led to a reception room, the walls of which were covered with polished glazed tiles, in gold and blue patterns, and the ceiling was gilded all over. Thence the ambassadors were taken to so many chambers, that it would take a long time to describe them all, in which there were ornamental works in gold and blue, and many other colours, executed with wonderful skill. They were also shown the apartments which the lord has caused to be made for his women, which were covered with strange and rich ornaments, both on the walls, ceilings, and floors; and many skilled workmen were employed in this palace.\n\nAfterwards the ambassadors went to see a chamber, which the lord had set apart for feasting, and for the company of his women.\n\nIn front of it there was a great garden, in which there were many shady trees, and all kinds of fruit trees, with channels of water flowing amongst them. The garden was so large, that great numbers of people might enjoy themselves there in summer with great delight, near the fountains, and under the shade of the trees. The workmanship of this palace was so rich that it would be impossible to describe it, without gazing and walking over everything, with slow steps. The mosque and palace are amongst the magnificent edifices which the lord has ordered to be built, in honour of his father, who lies interred there, and was a native of this city. But though he was a native of this city, he did not belong to the races of this land, but was of a lineage called Zagatay, which came from the land of Tartary when this country was conquered, as will presently be related to you.",

    "Description":"On Monday, the 29th of September, the lord went to the city of Samarcand, and lodged in some houses near the entrance, which he had ordered to be built in honour of the mother of his wife Caño, who was interred in a chapel within these houses. These houses were very rich, and they were not yet finished, but every day there were men working at them. On this day the lord gave a great feast, and sent for the ambassadors. ...\n\nOn this day the ambassadors were brought to the plain, and, when they arrived, they found many handsome tents pitched, most of them on the banks of the river, close together, and it was a very beautiful sight.\n\nThe ambassadors went through some streets of tents, where they sold all that was required by this great host; and, when they were near the tents of the lord, they were placed under an awning, made of white linen cloth, ornamented with cloths of various colours, and it was long, and secured above by cords, to two poles, and there were many awnings of this kind on the plain, and they make them long and high, that the sun may be screened off, and that air may enter. \n\n...\n\nfreely. Near these awnings, there was a great and lofty pavilion, which was like a tent, only square, and three lances high. It was a hundred paces broad, and had four corners, and the ceiling was round, like a vault. It was pitched against twelve poles, each as large round as a man, measured round the chest. They were painted gold and blue, and other colours, and from corner to corner there were poles, three fastened together, and making one. When they pitched the tents, they used wheels, like those of a cart, which were turned by men, and they have ropes fixed in various directions, to assist them. From the vault of the ceiling of the pavilion silken cloths descended, between each of the poles, which were fastened to them, and when they were fastened, they made an arch from one side to the other. Outside this square pavilion, there were porticoes, joined above to the pavilion, and supported by twenty-four poles, not so large as the central ones, so that the whole pavilion was supported by thirty-six poles. From this pavilion at least five hundred red cords were extended, and inside there was a crimson carpet, beautifully ornamented with silken cloths of many colours, and embroidered with gold threads. In the centre of the ceiling there was the richest work of all ; and in the four corners were the figures of four eagles, with their wings closed. The outside of the pavilion was lined with silk cloths, in black, white, and yellow stripes.\n\nAt each corner there was a high pole, with a copper ball, and the figure of a crescent on the top; and in the centre, there was another tall pole, with a much larger copper ball and crescent; and, on the top of the pavilion, between these poles, there was a tower of silken cloths, with turrets, and an entrance door; and when the wind blew the pavilion about, or made the poles unsteady, men went on the top, and secured anything that was loose. This pavilion was so large and high that, from a distance, it looked like a castle ; and it was a very wonderful thing to see, and possessed more beauty than it is possible to describe.",

    "Description":"In this city of Samarcand there is much merchandize, which comes every year from Cathay, India, Tartary, and many other parts; and as there is not a place for the orderly and regular display of the merchandize for sale, the lord ordered that a street should be made in the city, with shops for the sale of merchandize, This street was commenced at one end of the city, and went through to the other. He entrusted this work to two of his Meerzas, and let them know that if they did not use all diligence to complete it, working day and night, their heads should answer for it.\n\nThese Meerzas began to work, by pulling down such houses as stood in the line by which the lord desired the street to run, and as the houses came down, their masters fled with their clothes and all they had : then, as the houses came down in front, the work went on behind. They made the street very broad, and covered it with a vaulted roof, having windows at intervals to let in the light.\n\nAs soon as the shops were finished, people were made to occupy them, and sell their goods; and at intervals in this street there were fountains. A great number of workmen came into the city, and those who worked in the daytime, were relieved by others who worked all night. Some pulled down houses, others levelled the ground, and others built the street; and day and night they made such a noise, that they seemed to be like so many devils.\n\nThis great work was finished in twenty days, which was very wonderful; and the owners of the houses which were pulled down went to certain Cayris,\" who were friends of the lord ; and one day, when they were playing at chess with the lord, they said that, as he had caused those houses to be destroyed, he ought to make some amends to the owners.",

    "Description":"The city of Samarcand is situated in a plain, and surrounded by an earthen wall. It is a little larger than the city of Seville, but, outside the city, there are a great number of houses, joined together in many parts, so as to form suburbs.\n\nThe city is surrounded on all sides by many gardens and vineyards, which extend in some directions a league and a half, in others two leagues, the city being in the middle. In these houses and gardens there is a large population, and there are people selling bread, meat, and many other things; so that the suburbs are much more thickly inhabited than the city within the walls. Amongst these gardens, which are outside the city, there are great and noble houses, and here the lord has several palaces. The nobles of the city have to year their houses amongst these gardens, and they are so extensive that, when a man approaches the city, he sees nothing but a mass of very high trees. Many streams of water flow through the city, and through these gardens, and among these gardens there are many cotton plantations, and melon grounds, and the melons of this land are good and plentiful ; and at Christmas time there is a wonderful quantity of melons and grapes. Every day so many camels come in, laden with melons, that it is a wonder how the people can eat them all.\n\nThey preserve them from year in the villages, in the same way as figs, taking off their skins, cutting them in large slices, and then drying them in the sun.\n\nOutside the city there are great plains, which are covered with populous villages, peopled by the captives which the lord caused to be taken from the countries which he conquered. The land is very plentiful in all things, as well bread as wine, fruit, meat, and birds; and the sheep are very large, and have long tails, some weighing twenty pounds, and they are as much as a man can hold in his hand. These sheep are so abundant in the market that, even when the lord was there with all his host, a pair was worth only a ducat. Other things are so plentiful, that for a meri, which is half a rial, they sell a fanegal and a half of barley, and the quantity of bread and rice is infinite.\n\nThe city is so large, and so abundantly supplied, that it is wonderful; and the name of Samarcand or Cimes-quinte is derived from the two words cimes great, and quinte a town. The supplies of this city do not consist of food alone, but of silks, satins, gauzes, tafetas, velvets, and other things. The lord had so strong a desire to ennoble this city, that he brought captives to increase its population, from every land which he conquered, especially all those who were skilful in From Damascus he brought weavers of silk, and men who made bows, glass, and earthenware, so that, of those articles, Samarcand produces the best in the world. From Turkey he brought archers, masons, and silversmiths. He also brought men skilled in making engines of war : and he sowed hemp and flax, which had never before been seen in the land.\n\nThere was so great a number of people brought to this city, from all parts, both men and women, that they are said to have amounted to one hundred and fifty thousand persons, of many nations, Turks, Arabs, and Moors, Christian Armenians, Greek Catholics, and Jacobites, and those who baptize with fire in the face, who are Christians with peculiar opinions. There was such a multitude of these people that the city was not large enough to hold them, and it was wonderful what a number lived under trees, and in caves outside.\n\nThe city is also very rich in merchandize which comes from other parts. Russia and Tartary send linen and skins ; China sends silks, which are the best in the world, (more especially the satins), and musk, which is found in no other part of the world, rubies and diamonds, pearls and rhubarb, and many other things. The merchandize which comes from China is the best and most precious which comes to this city, and they say that the people of China are the most skilful workmen in the world. They say themselves that they have two eyes, the Franks one, and that the Moors are blind, so that they have the advantage of every other nation in the world. From India come spices, such as nutmegs, cloves, mace, cinnamon, ginger, and many others which do not reach Alexandria.\n\nIn the city there are many open places, in which they sellmeat cooked in many ways, fowls and other birds very nicely dressed ; and they are always selling, day and night, in these places. There are also many places for killing meat, fowls, pheasants, and partridges. At one end of the city there is a castle, which is defended on one side by a stream flowing through a deep ravine, and is very strong. The lord kept his treasure in that castle, and no man entered it except the magistrate and his officers. In this castle the lord had as many as a thousand captives, who were skilful workmen, and laboured all the year round at making head pieces, and bows and arrows.",

On the banks there were great plains of sand, and the sand was moved from one part to another, by the wind, and thrown up in mounds. In this sandy waste there are great valleys and hills, and the wind blew the sand away from one hill to another, for it was very light; and on the ground, where the wind had blown away the sand, the marks of waves and could not keep their eyes on this sand, when the sun was shining. This road cannot be travelled over, without a guide who knows the marks and signs of the desert, and these guides are called Anchies, and the ambassadors had one of these guides. On this road there is no water, except a few wells sunk in the sand, with vaulted roofs, and surrounded by brick walls, for if they were not covered, the sand would fill them up. The water of these wells is either rain or snow water; and in the last day's journey, they found no water, and they travelled all night; but at the hour of mass they came to a well, and drank, and gave water to their beasts, and they all had much need of it.\n\n[Location uncertain]",

They were eight days in this city, because they were forced to go and visit a grandson of the lord Timour Beg, named Omar Meerza, who was lord of Persia and other countries, and was wintering with his host in the plain which they call Karabagh. The most direct road to go there was by this city of Sultanieh, but as there was much snow on a range of mountains which they would have to cross, they waited until it became passable. Finally they were advised to go on to the city of Tabreez, whence they might more easily reach Karabagh, and they decided upon doing so.",
